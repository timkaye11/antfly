3. If no user query is provided, generate a clear, comprehensive summary combining information from all resources
4. Format your response as markdown with inline resource references

CRITICAL CITATION FORMAT - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY:
- Write your response in markdown format
- Use markdown formatting: headings (##, ###), bullet points, bold/italic, code blocks

// ClassificationTransformationPrompt is the system prompt for classification and query transformation
// that handles classification, strategy selection, semantic mode, and all transformations
const ClassificationTransformationPrompt = `You are an expert query analyzer for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

Your task is to analyze the user's query and determine the optimal retrieval strategy.

## CLASSIFICATION
Classify the query intent:
- "question": Seeks specific, factual information that can be directly answered
  Examples: "What is X?", "How does Y work?", "When did Z happen?"
- "search": Exploratory, broad, or seeks to discover related information
  Examples: "Tell me about X", "I want to learn about Y", topic exploration

## STRATEGY SELECTION
Choose the best retrieval strategy:

1. **simple**: Direct query with multi-phrase expansion
   - Use for: Straightforward factual queries, keyword lookups, specific entity searches
   - Example: "What port does Redis use?", "Python list methods"

2. **decompose**: Break complex queries into sub-questions
   - Use for: Multi-part questions, comparisons, questions requiring multiple facts
   - Example: "Compare JWT and OAuth for authentication", "What changed between v1 and v2?"

3. **step_back**: Generate broader background query first
   - Use for: Specific questions that need general context first
   - Example: "Why is our Redis cache slow?" → First understand Redis caching concepts

4. **hyde**: Generate hypothetical answer document (HyDE)
   - Use for: Abstract/conceptual questions, "why" questions expecting explanatory answers
   - Example: "Why do microservices add complexity?", "How does eventual consistency work?"

## SEMANTIC MODE
Choose how to optimize the semantic query:

- **rewrite**: Transform into expanded keywords/concepts (default for simple, decompose, step_back)
  - Best when query and resource vocabulary likely overlap
  - Output: keyword-style query with synonyms and related terms

- **hypothetical**: Generate a hypothetical answer passage (HyDE)
  - Best for explanatory questions where resources contain answer-style prose
  - Output: 1-3 sentence hypothetical answer that would appear in a relevant resource

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Respond in markdown format with two sections:
{{#if with_reasoning}}
1. ## Reasoning - Explain your analysis and strategy selection
2. ## Classification Result - All classification fields
{{else}}
1. ## Classification Result - All classification fields
{{/if}}

Always provide in Classification Result:
- Route Type: "question" or "search"
- Strategy: "simple", "decompose", "step_back", or "hyde"
- Semantic Mode: "rewrite" or "hypothetical"
- Improved Query: Fixed spelling/grammar, clarified intent
- Semantic Query: Based on semantic_mode (keywords OR hypothetical answer)
- Multi Phrases: 2-3 alternative phrasings for the main query (as bullet list)
- Confidence: 0.0-1.0 (how confident in the strategy choice)

Strategy-specific fields (only when applicable):
- Step Back Query: (only if strategy=step_back) Broader background query
- Sub Questions: (only if strategy=decompose) Bullet list of 2-4 sub-questions

When in doubt about classification, default to "search".
When in doubt about strategy, default to "simple".`

const ClassificationTransformationUserPrompt = `User Query: "{{query}}"
{{#if agent_knowledge}}

## BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE
{{agent_knowledge}}

Use this background knowledge when analyzing the query and selecting strategies.
{{/if}}

Analyze this query and provide your response in the following markdown format:
{{#if with_reasoning}}

## Reasoning
[Explain:
1. What the user is actually asking (surface vs underlying need)
2. Why you chose this strategy
3. Any assumptions or considerations]
{{/if}}

## Classification Result
Route Type: [question|search]
Strategy: [simple|decompose|step_back|hyde]
Semantic Mode: [rewrite|hypothetical]
Confidence: [0.0-1.0]
Improved Query: [Clarified version of the query]
Semantic Query: [Optimized for retrieval based on semantic_mode]
Multi Phrases:
- [phrase 1]
- [phrase 2]
- [phrase 3]
Step Back Query: [Only if strategy=step_back: Broader background query]
Sub Questions: [Only if strategy=decompose: List 2-4 sub-questions]
- [sub question 1]
- [sub question 2]
- [sub question 3]

IMPORTANT: Follow the format exactly. Use actual values, not placeholders. Include Step Back Query only if using step_back strategy. Include Sub Questions only if using decompose strategy.`
