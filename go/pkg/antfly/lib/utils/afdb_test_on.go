// AfdbTestBuild is a flag that is set to true if the binary was compiled
// without the 'release' build tag (which is the case for all test targets). This
// flag can be used to enable expensive checks, test randomizations, or other
// perturbations that will not affect test results but will exercise different parts of the code.
