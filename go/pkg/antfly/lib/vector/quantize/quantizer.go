// Quantizer quantizes a set of vectors to an equal-dimensionality set of
// representative quantized vectors, a compressed version of the original.

// the quantized form can be used to estimate the distance between the original vector
// and a query vector.
//
// Quantizer implementations must be thread-safe. There should typically be only
// one Quantizer instance in the process for each index.

// the requirements for the StackAllocator
