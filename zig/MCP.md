# Zig MCP Support

## Current State

This repo now has a reusable MCP protocol core under `go/pkg/antfly/lib/mcp`, plus Antfly-specific HTTP adapters in
`pkg/antfly/src/api/protocol_adapters.zig`.

The implementation intentionally keeps the protocol library independent of Antfly OpenAPI/generated types. Antfly tools
are registered at the product layer and delegate back through existing HTTP/API paths so auth, permission checks,
request validation, table/query behavior, backup/restore behavior, and agent behavior stay centralized.

A2A and native bounded-agent behavior are documented in `A2A.md`. This file keeps only the MCP surface and the explicit
handoff points where MCP clients should call native agents or A2A skills.

## Go Parity Context

The Go implementation uses mature protocol SDKs:

- MCP is mounted with `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp.NewStreamableHTTPHandler` in `go/pkg/antfly/src/mcp/mcp.go`. That
  SDK provides streamable HTTP sessions, `Mcp-Session-Id`, DELETE close, SSE reconnect behavior, and `Last-Event-ID`
  resumability. The Antfly Go product code exposes streamable HTTP; the SDK also supports stdio, but there is no
  Antfly-specific stdio server command wired in the Go tree.
- MCP tool schemas in Go are derived by the MCP SDK from typed argument structs and `json`/`mcp` tags in
  `go/pkg/antfly/src/mcp/mcp.go`, not handwritten JSON strings.

## Implemented

- `go/pkg/antfly/lib/mcp`
  - JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response handling.
  - MCP `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.
  - Tool registry API with `Server`, `Tool`, `ToolHandler`, and `CallToolResult`.
  - Text content, structured JSON results, and tool error results.
  - Transport-shaped streamable HTTP helpers for POST responses and GET endpoint events.
  - In-memory MCP session store interface/implementation and initialize-time `Mcp-Session-Id` response headers.
  - Session-scoped SSE event IDs and `Last-Event-ID` cursor handling for streamable HTTP GET.
  - Line-oriented stdio dispatch helper for newline-framed JSON-RPC messages.
  - Standalone tests via `zig build lib-mcp-test`.
- Antfly HTTP routes
  - `GET /mcp/v1`
  - `POST /mcp/v1`
- Trusted-principal auth
  - Antfly can accept `X-Antfly-Trusted-Principal: <token>` from a trusted upstream proxy when
    `ANTFLY_TRUSTED_PRINCIPAL_SECRET` is configured.
  - `ANTFLY_TRUSTED_PRINCIPAL_ISSUER` optionally constrains the token issuer. Issuer names are provider-owned; Antfly
    only verifies the configured trust boundary and maps the token's permissions, row filters, and metadata into the
    normal authenticated identity model.

## MCP Query Request Design

MCP is the deterministic database control and retrieval surface. It should expose exact table/index/document/query
operations, schema/capability discovery, and raw request pass-through. It should not duplicate the agentic query
planner. Natural-language query planning belongs in native `/agents/query-builder` or the A2A `query-builder` skill,
which can inspect context, propose a query plan, and then call MCP `query` with either shorthand args or a raw
`queryRequest`.

The MCP `query` tool has two modes:

1. Shorthand mode, for common agent calls. This keeps the existing MCP-friendly arguments such as `fullTextSearch`,
   `fullTextSearchField`, `semanticSearch`, `fields`, `limit`, `orderBy`, `indexes`, and `filterPrefix`.
2. Raw QueryRequest mode, for the full Antfly query contract. Callers pass `queryRequest`, which is forwarded as the
   JSON body for `POST /tables/{tableName}/query`.

Example raw QueryRequest call:

```json
{
  "tableName": "montessori_copilot_ft",
  "queryRequest": {
    "full_text_search": {
      "match": "individual freedom personality development",
      "field": "content"
    },
    "fields": ["document_title", "page", "content"],
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

The raw `queryRequest` path is intentionally generic. It can carry the OpenAPI `QueryRequest` fields such as `query`,
`full_text_search`, `filter_query`, `exclusion_query`, `semantic_search`, `embedding_template`, `indexes`,
`embeddings`, `fields`, `limit`, `offset`, `order_by`, `search_after`, `search_before`, `distance_under`,
`distance_over`, `search_effort`, `merge_config`, `count`, `profile`, `reranker`, `aggregations`, `graph_searches`,
`expand_strategy`, `document_renderer`, `pruner`, `join`, and `foreign_sources`.

Raw mode rules:

- `tableName` remains the MCP path/table selector.
- `queryRequest` must be a JSON object.
- `queryRequest` is mutually exclusive with shorthand query arguments. The adapter does not merge the two modes because
  precedence rules would otherwise drift from the REST/OpenAPI contract.
- `queryRequest.table` is rejected on table-scoped MCP calls. Use `tableName` instead.
- The raw object is validated by the same `/tables/{tableName}/query` path as direct REST calls.

The full OpenAPI schema is not inlined into every `tools/list` response because the schema is large and references
recursive query/reranker/graph/join definitions. The `query.queryRequest` input schema stays permissive with compact
top-level field guidance. Clients that need schema help can call `describe_query_request`, which returns a compact,
structured summary with examples and pointers to:

- `specs/openapi/antfly/metadata.yaml#/components/schemas/QueryRequest`
- `specs/openapi/antfly/query.yaml#/components/schemas/Query`

## MCP Introspection Tools

The MCP tool surface includes deterministic helpers so clients can discover table shape and build precise requests
without needing to scrape broad list responses:

- `describe_table` calls the existing table status route for one table, including schema, indexes, ranges, and storage
  status when available.
- `describe_indexes` calls the existing table index listing route for one table. It is intentionally an alias-shaped
  companion to `list_indexes` for clients that distinguish list and describe workflows.
- `sample_documents` calls the existing lookup/scan route with bounded `limit` and optional `from`, `to`,
  `inclusiveFrom`, and `fields` arguments. It is for schema/content inspection, not agentic retrieval planning.
- `describe_mcp_capabilities` returns MCP transport/session capabilities, deterministic tool categories, raw
  `queryRequest` support, shorthand query args, and native-agent query-builder handoff guidance.

These tools route through the same HTTP handlers as REST calls where possible. That keeps auth, permission checks,
validation, and error behavior aligned with the product API.

## Verification

- `zig build lib-mcp-test`
- `zig build raft-transport-test`
- `zig build lib-api-auth-test`
- `zig build root-test -- --test-filter "api http server serves fielded full-text search through mcp tools"`
- `go test ./src/mcp`

The API auth test bucket includes HTTP-level coverage for MCP initialize. It also covers MCP session response headers
and MCP GET event-stream endpoint framing.

The standalone protocol tests also cover parse errors, invalid params, and unknown MCP tools.

## Known Gaps

- MCP now creates server-side streamable HTTP sessions, returns `Mcp-Session-Id`/`Mcp-Protocol-Version` headers on
  initialize responses, validates inbound `Mcp-Session-Id` headers for streamable HTTP requests, and closes sessions
  via `DELETE /mcp/v1`. GET streams emit event IDs and honor `Last-Event-ID`, but historical event replay is not
  implemented yet.
- MCP has a line-oriented stdio JSON-RPC dispatcher in `go/pkg/antfly/lib/mcp`; the product CLI does not yet expose a long-running
  stdio server mode. This is also not exposed by Antfly's Go product code, even though the Go SDK supports it.
- The Antfly adapters now live in `protocol_adapters.zig`. MCP-specific adapter code can move to a dedicated module if
  the surface grows.
- Protocol structs are intentionally minimal. Dynamic `std.json.Value` remains the extension path for evolving MCP
  fields and tool payloads.
- MCP schemas are generated from Antfly MCP tool descriptors and cover the current Go-parity tool arguments. They are
  not yet derived from generated OpenAPI or Zig request structs. The raw `queryRequest` field deliberately uses a
  permissive schema plus the `describe_query_request` helper to avoid inlining the full recursive OpenAPI query schema
  into every MCP `tools/list` response.

## Long-Term Direction

The current shape is the right foundation: protocol cores stay reusable, while Antfly-specific tools and skills are
registered outside the libraries.

The next durability improvements should be:

1. Add MCP historical event replay if clients need more than cursor-aware stream continuation.
2. Expose the `go/pkg/antfly/lib/mcp` stdio dispatcher through a product CLI/server mode if local agent hosts need it.
3. Broaden adapter failure mapping, tool schema stability tests, and cross-language MCP parity tests.
4. Consider deriving MCP tool schemas from generated OpenAPI or Zig request structs if the tool surface continues to
   expand.

For Go product parity, the only remaining behavior difference worth tracking is MCP historical replay after
`Last-Event-ID`. The other items above are product extensions or maintainability improvements, not missing behavior in
the current Antfly Go MCP mount.
