# Antfly Lite

Antfly Lite is the embedded, local-first Antfly profile. It should feel like
SQLite for Antfly: a developer opens a local database from an application
process, writes documents and vectors, creates indexes, runs search and query
workloads, and can later promote the same data into a normal Antfly deployment.

The user-facing CLI surface is:

```sh
antfly lite <command>
```

The embedded library surface should use the same name in docs and packaging:
Antfly Lite.

## Goals

- Provide an embedded Antfly database with no server process.
- Keep the first-use path simple: `antfly lite init app.aflite`, then local
  reads, writes, search, backup, restore, and health checks.
- Preserve Antfly's core feature model: documents, schemas, text search, vector
  search, sparse search, graph edges, enrichments, and retrieval-oriented query
  APIs.
- Make upgrade to normal Antfly explicit and reliable through portable backup
  and restore.
- Keep the embedded API stable enough for language bindings.
- Make `.aflite` the public v1 database format, backed by a Lite-native
  single-file engine instead of exposing a temporary directory-backed user
  format.

## Non-Goals

- Antfly Lite is not a distributed database.
- Antfly Lite does not run Raft, shard placement, cluster metadata heartbeats,
  or multi-node balancing.
- Antfly Lite does not require local inference to be available.
- Antfly Lite does not need to support every operational feature of a normal
  Antfly cluster on day one.
- Antfly Lite should not silently emulate distributed behavior in ways that make
  later promotion surprising.
- Antfly Lite v1 should not include legacy fallback code for pre-release
  `.aflite`, directory-backed, or LSM-container experiments. Unknown versions
  and invalid headers should fail explicitly.

## Existing Starting Point

The repository already has the main ingredients:

- `pkg/antfly-embedded` exposes a standalone embedded package.
- `pkg/antfly/src/embedded/db.zig` wraps the high-level DB surface.
- `pkg/antfly/src/embedded/api.zig` exposes JSON-oriented helpers for batch,
  lookup, scan, search, stats, indexes, enrichments, capabilities, and
  `runUntilIdle`.
- `storage/db/db.zig` already supports open modes such as writer,
  query-readonly, and status-only.
- `storage/db/config.zig` already models primary backends as LMDB, memory, LSM
  memory, or durable LSM.
- The LSM backend already routes through a `Storage` abstraction with range
  reads, writes, append, rename, delete, and atomic write hooks.

That means the product work should harden and package the existing embedded
path while adding a Lite-native single-file backend that avoids translating the
embedded profile into many synthetic logical files. Directory-backed and
LSM-container storage can remain internal development, migration, and test
profiles, but `.aflite` should be the public v1 format.

## Product Shape

Antfly Lite has three related surfaces.

### CLI

The CLI should live under `antfly lite`:

```sh
antfly lite init app.aflite
antfly lite status app.aflite
antfly lite batch app.aflite --file writes.json
antfly lite query app.aflite --file query.json
antfly lite schema set app.aflite --file schema.json
antfly lite schema get app.aflite
antfly lite index create app.aflite --file index.json
antfly lite enrichment create app.aflite --file enrichment.json
antfly lite run-until-idle app.aflite
antfly lite backup app.aflite --out app.afb
antfly lite restore app.afb --out app.aflite
antfly lite export app.aflite --out app.afb
antfly lite import app.aflite --from app.afb
antfly lite check app.aflite
antfly lite compact app.aflite
antfly lite vacuum app.aflite
antfly lite serve app.aflite --addr 127.0.0.1:8080
```

`antfly lite init` should be non-destructive: it creates a new `.aflite` file
and rejects an existing database path. Destructive replacement should stay on
explicit restore/import flows where the source and target are both known.
`antfly lite import <db.aflite> --from <backup.afb>` may import into an existing
empty Lite database. `antfly lite import <db.aflite> --from <source.aflite>`
must be treated as a physical snapshot replacement and require `--replace` when
the target already exists; it should not silently merge one live Lite database
into another.

`antfly lite status` should include a storage block that identifies the live
file format, the selected engine, the primary, replay, and index layouts, the
v1 format version, page size, and active checkpoint sequence. That makes the
public native `.aflite` path observable and keeps internal bridge profiles from
being mistaken for the v1 contract.

For native `.aflite`, the public status contract should report
`primary_layout: native_document_pages`,
`replay_layout: native_replay_lanes_in_document_catalog`, and
`index_layout: native_index_catalog_pages`. Any LSM adapter used while the
native index engine is being completed is an implementation detail and must not
appear as the public index layout for native Lite files.

`antfly lite serve` is optional convenience mode. It should expose a narrow
local single-node HTTP API under `/lite/v1` for development, SDK smoke tests,
and migration testing, but the primary contract is embedded use. It should not
pretend to be the clustered `/db/v1` service API unless a future compatibility
profile is deliberately added. The v1 serve command should bind only to
loopback hosts; wildcard or LAN listeners should require a future explicit
remote/development override.

### Embedded Library

The library API should be small and boring:

- open/close
- batch writes/deletes
- lookup
- scan
- search/query
- add/drop/list index
- add/drop/list enrichment
- set/get schema
- run maintenance until idle
- status/stats
- backup/export
- restore/import
- integrity check

`libantfly` should be the long-term stable C ABI boundary. The storage-neutral
open surface, ABI evolution rules, and read-only backend contract live in
[`CAPI.md`](CAPI.md). Antfly Lite should not have a separate
independently-versioned ABI; `.aflite` is a storage/open mode and the
`antfly_lite_*` names are convenience entrypoints in the same `libantfly` ABI.

The C ABI should expose a single Lite status JSON call that mirrors
`antfly lite status`: storage identity, DB stats, pending work, and capability
flags. Bindings should not have to reconstruct Lite status by combining several
lower-level calls differently in each language.

The C ABI should also expose a path-level Lite check call, not only a
handle-level check. Bindings need to inspect invalid, truncated, or corrupted
`.aflite` files and receive the same JSON integrity report as `antfly lite
check` without first opening the database successfully.

The embedded Zig API should expose the same status shape for Lite handles, with
the storage identity available as a typed value on the lower-level DB wrapper.
It should also expose a path-level Lite integrity check so Zig users can inspect
invalid `.aflite` files without first opening a handle.

### File Format

Antfly Lite v1 should use `.aflite` as the live database format. Users should
not need to understand a temporary directory-backed layout.

The single-file database should be implemented as a Lite-native backend, not as
a long-term LSM directory packed into one file. The native backend should keep
Antfly's document, index, enrichment, query, backup, and restore semantics, but
map them onto file-local pages or segments directly. That avoids the extra I/O
and coordination introduced by emulating logical files, manifests, renames, and
asynchronous cleanup inside another single-file container.

The v1 production target should therefore be:

```text
Antfly DB and indexes
  -> Lite-native storage engine
    -> .aflite single-file database
```

An LSM-backed `.aflite` container can still be useful as an incremental
implementation bridge because it exercises the existing storage abstraction and
lets the CLI, C ABI, backup, restore, portable-interoperability, and
conformance tests land early. It should not define the long-term v1
architecture. If benchmarks show meaningful I/O and coordination savings from
the Lite-native path, the native backend is the v1 target, not a v2 candidate.

Directory-backed LSM storage should remain available as an internal development,
debug, and conformance-test profile. LSM-container storage should be treated the
same way. Neither should be the public Lite v1 contract.

### Compatibility Policy

Because this is new, unreleased code, v1 should not carry a legacy fallback,
pre-release importer, v0 directory reader, silent LSM-container upgrade path, or
prototype-to-v1 auto-migrator. Prototype files can be recreated from tests or
explicit exports while the format is still pre-release. `.aflite` readers should
accept the documented v1 format and reject unknown versions loudly. Recovery
from an older complete checkpoint root inside the same v1 file is crash
recovery, not legacy compatibility; a file with no complete v1 checkpoint should
fail with an explicit integrity error. Compatibility branches should only be
added after a format has shipped and users can reasonably have files that need
preservation.

The implementation consequence is that the production Lite open path should be
small and direct: parse the v1 header, validate the v1 checkpoint, recover within
the v1 format if needed, and otherwise return an explicit error. It should not
carry readers for discarded prototype layouts, and tests should assert rejection
of invalid headers, unsupported versions, and bridge-profile files opened through
the default `.aflite` path.

Internal bridge profiles are explicit developer/test engine selections, not
compatibility modes. The default `auto` path should never inspect a failed
native open and then silently retry a bridge or prototype layout.

The extension meanings should stay distinct:

- `.aflite` is a live Antfly Lite single-file database.
- `.afb` is the portable Antfly backup archive.
- `~/.antfly/lite/` may be used for CLI registry data, caches, temporary
  workspaces, and internal development databases, but not as the public database
  format.

## Storage Design

### Lite-Native Single-File Backend

The `.aflite` single-file format should be a database file with a native layout
for embedded Antfly data:

- database header and format version
- checkpoint roots
- catalog pages
- document key/value pages or segments
- text index files
- dense vector/HBC posting files
- sparse posting files
- graph reverse indexes
- catalog records
- enrichment definitions and state
- free-space map
- integrity metadata
- optional append journal or commit log

The backend should provide Antfly database operations directly:

- point lookup
- ordered scan
- compare-and-set or transaction commit
- index definition reads and writes
- posting-list reads and writes
- vector/HBC reads and writes
- graph edge reads and writes
- enrichment queue/state reads and writes
- snapshot creation for readers, backup, and restore
- page or segment allocation and reclamation

Important correctness rules:

- Atomic publish must survive process crash.
- Readers must not observe a partially committed transaction.
- The backend must support integrity checking.
- The backend must support online backup or a consistent checkpoint.
- Vacuum/compaction should be explicit.

LMDB may still be useful for an LMDB profile, but it should not be the only
Antfly Lite story. LMDB gives an mmap data file plus a lock file and fits a
simple KV shape well. Antfly's richer index stack already has its own LSM and
posting-file needs, so the native backend gives us a more general product while
removing the I/O cost of pretending those structures are separate filesystem
objects.

### Internal LSM Profiles

The durable LSM directory and LSM-container layouts should remain useful
internally:

- exercising existing LSM conformance tests
- comparing native `.aflite` behavior against the current filesystem storage
- debugging corruption or recovery issues
- measuring native backend performance against the bridge implementation

These profiles should be hidden behind developer flags or build steps. They
should not appear in the normal user docs as Lite database formats.

## Concurrency Model

Antfly Lite should match the familiar embedded database model:

- One writer at a time.
- Multiple concurrent readers where backend snapshots support it.
- Cross-process locking for the database path.
- Read-only opens for tooling and inspection.
- Clear `ANTFLY_BUSY` errors when another process or in-process write handle
  owns the writer lock.

The CLI should expose this plainly:

```sh
antfly lite status app.aflite
antfly lite query app.aflite --readonly --file query.json
```

The embedded API should expose open profiles:

- writer
- readonly query
- status only
- hosted/manual maintenance

## Upgrade To Normal Antfly

Upgrade should be backup/restore first.

The durable, user-facing archival contract is the portable Antfly backup format,
not a physical copy of the Lite storage engine. A Lite database should export
the same portable logical content that a normal Antfly backend can restore:

- documents
- schemas
- index definitions
- enrichment definitions
- reusable enrichment artifacts where portable
- dense embeddings
- sparse embeddings
- graph edges
- resolver/promotion artifacts where portable
- table and shard metadata in a single-shard layout

The flow:

```sh
antfly lite backup app.aflite --out app.afb
antfly restore --format portable --input app.afb --table docs
```

or:

```sh
antfly lite promote app.aflite --target http://cluster:8080 --table docs
```

`promote` should just orchestrate portable backup upload plus normal restore. It
should not invent a separate migration protocol until backup/restore proves too
slow for large databases.

When `antfly lite promote` needs a local staging location and the user does not
pass `--location`, it should use `~/.antfly/lite/backups`, not a process-global
`/tmp` directory. Explicit `--location` values continue to support normal
Antfly backup targets such as `file://`, `s3://`, or `gs://`.
The direct normal restore shortcut for `.aflite` input should use the same
Lite-local default staging location when `--location` is omitted.

Normal Antfly should also be able to restore directly from a `.aflite` live
database file:

```sh
antfly restore --input app.aflite --table docs
```

That direct path should not make `.aflite` the backup format. It should open
the `.aflite` database read-only, stream portable logical restore records, and
restore them into normal Antfly. `.afb` remains the stable cross-backend,
archival, streamable backup format. `.aflite` remains a live embedded database.

### Upgrade Semantics

Lite is a single-node, single-shard source. Restore into normal Antfly should:

- create the target table if requested
- restore source documents
- restore schemas and index/enrichment definitions
- rebuild or import indexes according to restore policy
- map the Lite single shard into the cluster's placement model
- start normal Antfly background workers after restore
- report replay/enrichment/index readiness through normal status APIs

Indexes should default to logical rebuild on restore. Physical index restore can
be an optimization later when the source and target backend formats match.

### Downgrade / Extract

The reverse path should also work:

```sh
antfly backup --format portable --table docs --out docs.afb
antfly lite restore docs.afb --out docs.aflite
```

This makes Lite useful for local development, debugging production data slices,
offline demos, and customer support bundles.

## Enrichments And Inference

Antfly Lite should preserve the enrichment model, but inference execution needs
clear modes. Enrichments are part of Antfly's feature set; inference is an
execution dependency that may be local, remote, caller-supplied, or disabled.

### Enrichment Modes

Supported modes:

1. Caller-supplied artifacts.
2. Remote inference provider.
3. Local embedded inference.
4. Manual maintenance.
5. Disabled/deferred enrichment.

#### Caller-Supplied Artifacts

This is the most reliable default. Applications can write documents with
precomputed `_embeddings`, extracted assets, chunk artifacts, graph edges, or
other enrichment outputs. Lite persists and indexes them without needing a model
runtime.

This mode should be the default for small applications and language bindings.

#### Remote Inference Provider

Lite can call a configured Antfly inference service, OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
or other provider through the existing enrichment/provider interfaces.

The CLI should support:

```sh
antfly lite enrichment create app.aflite --file embedding-index.json
antfly lite run-until-idle app.aflite
```

Configuration must be explicit. A local file opened by a library should not
unexpectedly start sending data to a network provider.

#### Local Embedded Inference

Local inference should be optional packaging:

- `antfly lite` base build: database, search, vector indexes, no heavy model
  runtime requirement.
- `antfly lite` full build: bundled or dynamically available inference runtime.
- Application embedding: caller links the inference runtime if wanted.

Local inference is important for demos and offline use, but it should not be
required for the core embedded database.

#### Manual Maintenance

Hosted/manual mode is important for environments such as WASM, mobile, plugins,
or apps that want deterministic control of background work. In this mode, writes
record replay/enrichment debt and the application drives progress:

```zig
try db.runUntilIdle();
```

The CLI equivalent is:

```sh
antfly lite run-until-idle app.aflite
```

#### Disabled Or Deferred Enrichment

Users must be able to open a Lite database without configured inference. In that
case:

- writes still succeed if enrichment outputs are not required synchronously
- pending work is visible in status
- capabilities/status reports `inference_mode`,
  `no_inference_configured_ok`, and whether caller-supplied artifacts, remote
  providers, or a local inference runtime are available
- queries that depend on missing index material return clear readiness/status
  information
- backup includes pending definitions and source documents
- restore into a normal Antfly deployment can resume enrichment

## Feature Coverage

Antfly Lite should aim for feature parity at the API level where the feature is
single-node and local.

### Should Work In Lite

- document writes/deletes
- lookup and scan
- schemas
- text search
- dense vector search
- sparse vector search
- hybrid search
- graph edges and graph query where local-only
- generated enrichments
- caller-supplied embeddings/assets
- local or remote inference-backed enrichment
- TTL cleanup
- local transactions/OCC where supported by the DB layer
- backup/restore/export/import
- integrity check
- compaction/vacuum
- read-only inspection

### Should Be Explicitly Unsupported Or Different

- distributed shard ownership
- Raft replication
- cluster placement
- cross-node joins
- remote shard fanout
- distributed transaction coordination
- server-side autoscaling
- Kubernetes operator behavior
- cluster heartbeat/status aggregation
- S3/object-storage native serving as the primary Lite file

Some of these can still be simulated for testing, but they should not be
presented as production Lite capabilities. Lite status and capabilities should
advertise these distributed-only features as explicit `false` values so
bindings do not have to infer cluster semantics from missing fields.

## CLI Details

Suggested command groups:

```text
antfly lite init
antfly lite info
antfly lite status
antfly lite check
antfly lite batch
antfly lite lookup
antfly lite scan
antfly lite query
antfly lite index list
antfly lite index create
antfly lite index drop
antfly lite enrichment list
antfly lite enrichment create
antfly lite enrichment drop
antfly lite schema get
antfly lite schema set
antfly lite run-until-idle
antfly lite compact
antfly lite vacuum
antfly lite backup
antfly lite restore
antfly lite promote
antfly lite serve
```

The CLI should accept JSON request files that match the public API contracts.
This keeps Lite compatible with normal Antfly examples, tests, and SDKs.

## Packaging

Packages:

- `antfly` CLI with `antfly lite` subcommands.
- `antfly-embedded` Zig package.
- `libantfly` C ABI artifact, with `.aflite` exposed as an embedded storage
  profile rather than a separate Lite-only ABI.
- Language bindings generated or hand-written over the C ABI.
- Optional full package with embedded inference runtime.

Build profiles:

- `lite-core`: embedded database, indexes, CLI, and narrow `/lite/v1` local
  serve mode, with no heavyweight inference runtime.
- `lite-full`: embedded database plus local inference runtime.
- `lite-wasm`: hosted/manual maintenance profile.
- `lite-dev`: debug/status tooling and compatibility experiments.

## Testing

Minimum test matrix:

- open/close/reopen durability
- crash during write
- crash during index update
- crash during commit/checkpoint publish
- reader/writer concurrency
- read-only open while writer exists
- online backup or snapshot while a write transaction is open
- backup from Lite, restore into normal Antfly
- backup from normal Antfly, restore into Lite
- direct restore from `.aflite` into normal Antfly through a portable restore
  stream
- enrichment disabled, then resumed
- caller-supplied embeddings search
- remote inference-backed enrichment
- local inference-backed enrichment where available
- integrity check detects truncated or corrupted database pages, segments, or
  journal data

The most important compatibility test is a round trip:

```text
Lite -> portable backup -> normal Antfly -> portable backup -> Lite
```

The restored documents, schemas, definitions, embeddings, graph edges, and
query-visible results should match within documented index rebuild semantics.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Lite-Native Single-File Backend

- Implement a Lite-native storage backend for embedded Antfly.
- Add database header, catalog roots, page or segment allocator, free-space map,
  commit/checkpoint publish, crash recovery, integrity checks, and vacuum.
- Preserve Antfly's document ordering, range scans, index definitions,
  enrichment state, vector/HBC artifacts, sparse artifacts, graph artifacts,
  backup, and restore semantics.
- Add `.aflite` as the live single-file database format.
- Run existing DB conformance tests against the native `.aflite` backend.
- Keep filesystem-backed LSM and LSM-container profiles as developer/test-only
  bridge paths.
- Do not add legacy fallback code for pre-release Lite layouts, v0 directories,
  or LSM-container prototypes; reject unknown versions and invalid headers with
  explicit errors while preserving same-format checkpoint recovery.
- Add negative open tests proving that the default `.aflite` path does not fall
  back to bridge profiles or prototype readers.

### Phase 2: Name And CLI Shell

- Add `antfly lite` command group.
- Wire commands to existing embedded DB APIs.
- Add `init`, `status`, `batch`, `lookup`, `scan`, `query`, `run-until-idle`.
- Make `antfly lite init app.aflite` create a single-file database.
- Keep `~/.antfly/lite/` for CLI registry data, caches, temporary workspaces,
  and internal developer databases only.

### Phase 3: Portable Upgrade Path

- Add `antfly lite backup`.
- Add `antfly lite restore`.
- Treat `antfly lite export` as an alias for backup and `antfly lite import`
  as the inverse restore shape.
- Add `antfly lite promote` as a wrapper around portable backup and normal
  restore.
- Add normal Antfly restore support for `.aflite` input by opening it read-only
  and producing the same portable logical restore stream as `.afb`. The normal
  CLI shape should be:

  ```sh
  antfly restore --input app.aflite --table docs
  ```

- Extend portable backup coverage for schema, index definitions, enrichment
  definitions, and portable artifacts that are not yet included.

### Phase 4: Embedded API Hardening

- Define stable `libantfly` C ABI.
- Add ownership/error/result conventions.
- Expose stable error-code names and descriptions for language bindings.
- Provide a buffer free-and-zero helper for generated bindings while retaining
  the raw pointer/length free function.
- Add Go as the first post-Zig/C binding in `go/pkg/antflylite`, backed by the
  stable C ABI and gated C-library smoke tests.
- Freeze the Lite open options and capabilities response.

### Phase 5: Enrichment And Inference Profiles

- Add explicit inference modes.
- Make "no inference configured" a clean status, not an error-prone partial
  setup.
- Expose inference profile fields in Lite status and capabilities so embedded
  users and bindings can branch without probing errors.
- Support caller-supplied artifacts as the default happy path.
- Support remote inference providers.
- Support optional local inference builds.

### Phase 6: Product Polish

- Add docs and examples.
- Add app templates for common embedded use cases.
- Add migration guides.
- Add package publishing for CLI and language bindings.

## Open Questions

- Which enrichment artifacts are portable enough to backup/restore directly,
  and which should always be rebuilt?
- What is the minimum local inference package that is small enough for Lite
  users but useful enough for demos?

## Recommendation

Ship Antfly Lite v1 as `.aflite`, not as a public directory-backed format. This
keeps the product mental model simple: a Lite database is a file, and a portable
backup is an `.afb` archive.

This moves more work into v1 because the Lite-native storage engine must exist
before the public Lite launch. That is the right tradeoff: it keeps the UX clean
and avoids shipping a synthetic LSM container whose extra logical-file churn,
vacuum pressure, and coordination become the public architecture.

The naming recommendation is:

- Live single-file Lite database: `*.aflite`
- Portable backup archive: `*.afb`
- CLI/internal workspace: `~/.antfly/lite/`
