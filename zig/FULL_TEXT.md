# Full-Text Indexing

## Goal

Full-text visibility semantics stay aligned with the LSM path:

- write/sync waits for search visibility, not full compaction
- segment merges run as background maintenance
- explicit force-compaction stays available as an admin/test hammer

## Current Policy

1. `SyncLevel.full_text` means the affected documents are searchable in the
   relevant full-text indexes.
2. Scheduled text merges are background work owned by the text-merge runtime and
   its resource budgets.
3. `runUntilIdle()` drains scheduled text merges as part of idle maintenance.
4. `drainScheduledTextMerges()` is the explicit blocking API for "finish the
   merges that are already scheduled".
5. `forceCompactTextIndexes()` remains the heavy hammer that aggressively
   rewrites text indexes beyond the normal merge scheduler. It reserves
   text-merge buffers through the normal resource-budget path (`.strict`
   mode), so its memory behavior is observable alongside scheduled merges
   instead of silently bypassing the budget.
6. `bestEffortForceCompactTextIndexes()` runs the same merge loop in
   `.best_effort` mode: it defers or stops as soon as it would exceed the
   text-merge resource budget or the scheduler reports resource pressure,
   leaving the remaining merge debt scheduled (`TextMergeScheduler.schedule`)
   instead of forcing all the way to a single segment.

## Why

The old shape mixed two different concerns:

- search visibility / replay catch-up
- segment merge compaction

That made `full_text` sync heavier than it needed to be and hid the real cost of
forced compaction in normal maintenance timings. Splitting them keeps sync
latency tied to visibility only, while merge cost is amortized as background
maintenance.

## Field Layout

Full-text field names follow Elasticsearch-style multi-field naming rather than
the older Zig-only convention.

- Exact string companions use `.keyword`.
- `search_as_you_type` emits `._2gram`, `._3gram`, and `._index_prefix`.
- `._2gram` and `._3gram` are shingle fields for multi-token
  search-as-you-type matching.
- Prefix/autocomplete matching targets `._index_prefix`; it is
  phrase-prefix oriented and indexes edge n-grams over
  one-, two-, and three-token shingles so prefixes such as `brown f` and
  `quick brown f` can match without scanning stored documents. This is closer
  to Elasticsearch's `search_as_you_type` prefix behavior than plain per-token
  edge n-grams.
- Schema-less string indexing emits both the analyzed field and a bounded
  `.keyword` companion so term/terms filters can use postings without widening
  vector queries through stored-document scans.
- Public filter rewriting maps term/terms filters to `.keyword` only when
  the target text snapshot contains that field. If the postings are absent, the
  query falls back or fails closed rather than treating the missing field as
  a valid empty result.

This intentionally breaks from the old Zig-only `__keyword` / `__2gram` suffixes
and from the Go/Bleve naming: the public query surface, schema-derived fields,
dynamic-template variants, and schema-less exact fields all use one familiar
subfield convention, adopted before compatibility constraints would have made
the layout expensive to change.

## Search-As-You-Type Design

The JSON Schema surface stays valid JSON Schema; the standard `type` field is
not overloaded with Elasticsearch field types. The shorthand is:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "x-antfly-types": ["search_as_you_type"]
}
```

When configuration is needed, a separate extension object is used instead of a
list of typed objects inside `x-antfly-types`:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "x-antfly-field": {
    "type": "search_as_you_type",
    "analyzer": "standard",
    "max_shingle_size": 3,
    "fields": {
      "keyword": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```

`x-antfly-types` stays a compact compatibility shorthand that desugars to
`x-antfly-field` defaults. A list of objects inside `x-antfly-types` would turn
the extension into a second mapping DSL and make validation, schema diffing,
dynamic templates, and compatibility harder — that shape was rejected.

`search_as_you_type` uses the Elasticsearch default `max_shingle_size = 3`
internally and does not expose a public knob.

The query surface uses an Elasticsearch-style `multi_match` query with
`type: "bool_prefix"` rather than an Antfly-only standalone bool-prefix
operator:

```json
{
  "full_text_search": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "quick brown f",
      "type": "bool_prefix",
      "fields": ["name"]
    }
  }
}
```

For `search_as_you_type` root fields, Antfly expands the root field to the
generated autocomplete fields:

```json
{
  "full_text_search": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "quick brown f",
      "type": "bool_prefix",
      "fields": ["name", "name._2gram", "name._3gram"]
    }
  }
}
```

The explicit generated-field form is also accepted, for Elasticsearch
familiarity and advanced scoring control. The shorthand `fields: ["name"]`
remains the normal Antfly path so users do not have to manually list generated
subfields for autocomplete.

Internally this lowers to the existing boolean, term, and prefix query
machinery. Completed terms match the root and shingle fields, and the final
partial phrase is satisfied through `._index_prefix`.

## Segment Build

The segment builder writes stored docs, ordinal sidecars, inverted sections, and
typed doc values directly. It does not retain a full intermediate `Batch`.
Temporary per-document term maps borrow analyzer token slices until the document
has been added to each field's inverted builder; the inverted builder then
re-keys terms into its own arena for segment lifetime ownership.

When the mapper has already parsed and sanitized a document for full-text
projection, it passes that parsed typed source into the segment builder instead
of materializing an intermediate typed-field array. Raw schemaless fast-path
documents explicitly skip typed collection.

Built per-field inverted sections are transferred into the segment writer
without a second section-buffer copy. Stored JSON is borrowed by the segment
writer until `build()` finishes.

Stored fields use a v3 offset-table layout that keeps O(1) doc lookup but writes
raw stored JSON instead of compressing each tiny document independently. Older
v2 per-doc Snappy segments still read and merge correctly.

Text analysis and per-document term accumulation use a reusable
document-local arena. Analyzer tokens, temporary per-field term maps, position
lists, and materialized `TermHit` slices are released by resetting the arena
between documents after the persistent inverted builders have copied the needed
terms and positions. This keeps allocator churn out of the large schemaless
replay path without changing term ownership in the durable segment.

Documents whose text projection has no duplicate field names use a direct field
path: analyze one field, aggregate that field's terms, and add it to the
persistent inverted builder immediately. The older per-document field map path
is still used when repeated field names must be concatenated into one logical
field with shared positions.

For short fields whose analyzed token list has no repeated terms, the direct
field path skips the document-local term hash map entirely and emits one
`TermHit` per token. This follows the Lucene/Tantivy shape of avoiding generic
maps for the common "few unique tokens" document path, while keeping the
hash-map path for repeated terms and unusual analyzers.

Segment assembly stores each section's offset/length directly on the writer's
section records while appending section bytes. The final section index does not
build a separate location list or scan that list for every field section.

Field analyzer resolution is cached for the duration of one segment build, so
repeated dynamic field names do not rescan the text-analysis config for every
document.

Analyzer token-list builders return owned slices directly instead of
duplicating the temporary token array. The lowercase filter also skips allocation
for tokens that contain no ASCII uppercase bytes, and the stop-word filter
passes through the original token slice when it removes nothing.

The default English analyzer has a fused `unicode_words -> lowercase ->
stop_words -> Porter2` path. It tokenizes once, drops stop words before owning
term bytes, and only allocates the output terms that survive analysis. Porter2
also has a conservative final-byte precheck so generated terms whose suffix
cannot be modified skip the stemmer's region scans.

`IndexWriter.addSegmentWithIdData` updates append-only BM25 field-length stats
incrementally by cloning the previous snapshot stats and reading only the new
segment's inverted-section headers. Segment replacement and merge paths still
rebuild stats from the replacement segment list because those operations remove
or reorder existing segment entries.

File-backed persistent text segments do not write the full segment bytes to
the segment WAL. The segment file is atomically published before active metadata
is committed, so crash recovery can treat pre-commit files as harmless orphans
and post-commit metadata as authoritative. Inline segment storage still uses the
WAL because the segment bytes live inside the metadata store transaction.

## Observability

Segment-builder internals are reported through the `antfly_bench_text_index`
benchmark log when `ANTFLY_BENCH_METRICS=1` is enabled, including analyzer time,
term accumulation, term-hit materialization, typed-field collection/build,
segment encoding, token counts, term-hit counts, and emitted segment bytes. The
same log separates section attachment, stored-doc attachment, stored-doc
compression, and final segment assembly from the broader `segment_encode_ms`
bucket. `antfly_bench_text_publish` logs WAL, metadata, writer-publish, and
truncate timings for the file-backed segment publish path.

`replay_bench.zig` reports per-index segment counts and bytes at each stage of
a replay/catch-up run (`text_index`, `text_index_before`,
`text_index_after_idle`, `text_index_after_force_compact`), plus text-merge
scheduler counters (pending segments, pending bytes, completed merges,
backpressure events) and resource-manager slice stats for
`full_text_pending_segments` (used/peak bytes, soft-limit events, hard-limit
rejections, pressure state).

Use this breakdown before changing analyzer or segment layout code. The
optimization order, highest-leverage first, is:

1. remove duplicated typed-field work and stored-JSON reparsing
2. reduce analyzer token allocation/copying
3. reduce per-document term-map churn
4. improve segment encoding pre-sizing and remaining final-output copy behavior

## Open work

- `generated_chunked_full_text` still piggybacks on dense-generator config
  (a `dense_embedding` generator with a chunker that sets `full_text_index`)
  rather than having a first-class chunked full-text generator kind.
- A future Lucene-style stored-field format could compress blocks of docs,
  not individual small docs, so the write path does not spend most of segment
  assembly in per-document compression.
- Expose `max_shingle_size` as a public knob (values `2..4`) instead of the
  fixed default of 3.
