# Antfly C API

`libantfly` is the stable embedded C ABI boundary for Antfly. Storage layouts
are selected by open options; they are not separate ABIs. Language bindings
should target this API once and expose storage-specific conveniences on top.

The public header, `include/antfly.h`, is Apache-2.0 so bindings can vendor
or transcribe it; the Lite bindings built on it are Apache-2.0 too. The
`libantfly` library itself is ELv2 like the rest of the core.

## Naming

- `antfly_*`: library-level calls that take no database handle (ABI version,
  threading mode, errors, options, buffer and result frees, artifact ID
  decoding, restoring a backup to a new path).
- `antfly_db_*`: calls on an `antfly_db *` handle, for any storage kind.
- `antfly_lite_*`: operations on the `.aflite` single-file format itself
  (integrity checks, compaction, vacuum, stable snapshots), plus shortcuts
  that open one with default options.
- `antfly_inference_*`: calls on an `antfly_inference *` handle, which runs
  inference (embed, rerank, chunk, generate, and so on) without a database.

Each operation has one name. ABI version 2 removed the earlier `antfly_lite_*`
duplicates of storage-neutral calls and the separate Lite options struct.

## ABI Contract

- `antfly_abi_version()` returns the ABI version supported by the library.
- Every options struct starts with `abi_size`.
- Callers must initialize options with the matching `*_init` function before
  setting fields.
- Readers of options structs must only read fields fully covered by `abi_size`.
- Reserved fields must be zero when present.
- New fields may be appended to options structs without breaking older callers.
- Handles are opaque `antfly_db *` values and must be closed with
  `antfly_db_close`.
- Returned buffers are owned by the caller and must be released with
  `antfly_buffer_free`.

## Storage-Neutral Open Surface

The primary embedded open surface is storage-neutral:

- `antfly_db_open(path, out_handle)`
- `antfly_db_open_with_options(path, options, out_handle)`
- `antfly_db_create_with_options(path, options, out_handle)`

`antfly_open_options` selects:

- `storage_kind`: `ANTFLY_STORAGE_KIND_DIRECTORY` for a normal Antfly
  directory, or `ANTFLY_STORAGE_KIND_LITE` for a single-file `.aflite`.
- `open_mode`: writer, read-only query, or status-only.
- `profile`: native or hosted/manual maintenance.
- `flags`: `NO_SYNC`, `TTL_CLEANUP`, remote/local inference capability state,
  and generated-enrichment replay.
- storage sizing, TTL cleanup tuning, embedded-inference resource budgets,
  and `busy_timeout_ms`.

Directory storage is the default for the generic open APIs. The
`antfly_lite_open*` / `antfly_lite_create*` shortcuts open a `.aflite` file
with default options; pass `antfly_open_options` with
`ANTFLY_STORAGE_KIND_LITE` for anything else.
`antfly_db_create_with_options` currently provides exclusive create semantics
for `ANTFLY_STORAGE_KIND_LITE` only. Directory storage should use
`antfly_db_open_with_options`, which preserves the existing directory
open-or-create behavior until the directory backend exposes an exclusive create
primitive.

## Backup and Restore

Portable `.afb` backups are storage-neutral:

- `antfly_db_backup` writes a backup of the entire embedded database.
- `antfly_db_import_backup` imports one into an empty database of either kind.
- `antfly_restore_backup_json` and `antfly_restore_backup_file_json` create a
  new database at a path, of the storage kind in the passed
  `antfly_open_options` (NULL means directory storage). The database is built
  and indexed beside the destination, then published atomically; `replace`
  swaps out an existing one. A failed or interrupted restore leaves the
  destination holding either the complete old or the complete new database,
  never a partial or missing one. Replacing a directory database that any
  process has open (through libantfly or otherwise), or a Lite file whose
  writer lease is held, fails with `ANTFLY_BUSY`; so does opening a directory
  database while a restore publishes it. `ANTFLY_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` means the
  new database was published but its crash durability could not be confirmed.

A backup of either kind restores or imports into either kind.
`antfly_db_status_json` and `antfly_db_capabilities_json` likewise report on
any handle; the status `storage.format` is `"aflite"` or `"directory"`.

## Inference

`antfly_inference_open` starts the embedded inference runtime on its own,
with no database, and returns an `antfly_inference *` handle; close it with
`antfly_inference_close`. `antfly_inference_options` sets the models
directory, the same resource budgets as the `inference_*_budget_mb` open
options, and an optional per-call timeout. NULL options use the defaults.

Each call takes the request JSON and returns the response JSON of the
matching `/ai/v1` route of the inference HTTP API
(`specs/openapi/inference/api.yaml`), dispatched in memory to the same
handlers:

| Call | Route |
|---|---|
| `antfly_inference_embed_json` | `POST /embed` |
| `antfly_inference_rerank_json` | `POST /rerank` |
| `antfly_inference_chunk_json` | `POST /chunk` |
| `antfly_inference_generate_json` | `POST /generate` |
| `antfly_inference_generate_batch_json` | `POST /generate/batch` |
| `antfly_inference_rewrite_json` | `POST /rewrite` |
| `antfly_inference_decide_json` | `POST /decisions` |
| `antfly_inference_extract_json` | `POST /extract` |
| `antfly_inference_read_json` | `POST /read` (OCR) |
| `antfly_inference_transcribe_json` | `POST /transcribe` |
| `antfly_inference_list_models_json` | `GET /models` |

For decision question types, answer semantics, and SQL providers, see the
[typed decision guide](../docs/guides/decisions.md).

- Images and audio go inline in the JSON, as base64 or `data:` URIs.
- The `_json` calls return complete responses. To stream,
  `antfly_inference_generate_stream_json` calls a callback with each
  `chat.completion.chunk` as tokens are produced; the callback returns false
  to stop generation, and the call then returns `ANTFLY_CANCELLED`.
- The output buffer holds the response body even when a call fails, so a
  failure carries the runtime's JSON error. Free it either way. HTTP 404
  (for example a model that is not installed) maps to `ANTFLY_NOT_FOUND`,
  other 4xx to `ANTFLY_INVALID_ARGUMENT`, 429/503/504 and an elapsed timeout
  to `ANTFLY_BUSY`, and 501 or 507 (the model does not fit the budgets) to
  `ANTFLY_UNSUPPORTED`.
- Models are not downloaded on demand. `antfly_inference_pull_json`
  downloads one into the handle's models directory, like
  `antfly inference pull`, with an optional progress callback. Returning
  false from the callback cancels the download (`ANTFLY_CANCELLED`);
  completed files stay staged, so pulling again resumes. Close waits for a
  pull in progress.
- Callbacks always run on the thread that made the call, and the work waits
  for each one to return. The runtime works on its own threads and hands
  each result to the caller's thread, so bindings whose runtimes require that
  (koffi for Node, for example) are safe, and returning false is always
  honored: no further chunks are generated, and a cancelled pull never
  installs the model. The callback can only cancel when it is called:
  between generated tokens, or at a pull report (each file's start, every
  16 MiB, and its end).
- Models run in the calling process on every backend; see Inference In
  Process below. If the runtime cannot start, open returns
  `ANTFLY_UNSUPPORTED`.

Inference handles have the same guarantees as database handles (see Thread
Safety): any thread may call concurrently, close waits for in-flight calls,
and a closed handle, or a database handle passed by mistake, is rejected with
`ANTFLY_INVALID_ARGUMENT`. They live in a separate registry with its own
reserved address range on 64-bit POSIX targets, so there the two kinds can
never alias. Each handle owns its own runtime and loaded models; share one
handle rather than opening several.

## Inference In Process

libantfly runs every inference backend, including Metal, CUDA, and ONNX, in
the calling process. This applies to `antfly_inference` handles and to Lite
handles opened with local inference.

The `antfly` server runs those backends in a worker process instead, because
a GPU driver call or an ONNX model load has no per-call abort: the server
stops a stuck call by killing the worker and starting a new one. A library
cannot do that to its host program, so libantfly accepts the trade SQLite
makes and runs them in-process:

- Once a call reaches the device or driver it runs to completion.
  `call_timeout_ms`, and closing a handle, take effect when it returns.
  Calls on CPU backends still stop cooperatively.
- A GPU driver fault terminates the process.
- A session wedged in the driver blocks close instead of being abandoned.

## Read-Only Modes

Read-only open modes are part of the storage contract, not just a DB-layer write
guard:

- Lite native files open with read-only file access.
- LSM primary/index backends open physical storage in read-only mode.
- LMDB primary storage opens the LMDB environment read-only and does not create
  missing directories or databases.
- In-memory backends have no physical read-only state, but DB write APIs still
  reject mutations under read-only open modes.

`status_only` should be at least as restrictive as query read-only. It may
avoid starting optional background work where the storage implementation can
support that cleanly.

## Thread Safety

`libantfly` runs in one threading mode, equivalent to SQLite's default
"serialized" mode: any thread may call any function on any handle,
concurrently. `antfly_threading_mode()` reports it as
`ANTFLY_THREADING_SERIALIZED`, like `sqlite3_threadsafe()`, and the Lite
capabilities JSON carries `"threading": "serialized"`.

Embedded database and table handles share one serialized API fence so
local multi-table decisions and catalog changes cannot interleave with other
API calls. Cursor snapshots remain pinned between fetches while other
sessions execute. Managed owner handles retain four access classes:

| Class | Exports | Runs concurrently with |
|---|---|---|
| read | lookup, get_raw, scan, search (JSON, dense, text, wire, hits), graph queries, aggregates, stats, schema/index/enrichment listing, status, capabilities, check, pending-work stats, enrichment extract/compute | everything except exclusive calls |
| write | batch, transactions and intent resolution, compact, vacuum, snapshot | reads and maintenance; one write at a time per handle |
| maintain | run-until-idle, generated-enrichment replay, backup, stable snapshot copy | reads and writes; one maintenance call at a time per handle |
| exclusive | set schema, add/delete index or enrichment, import a backup into a handle, range and split changes, shadow index managers, readable lease hook | nothing; waits for in-flight calls |

Concurrent calls on an embedded database queue behind each other instead
of failing with `ANTFLY_BUSY`. Managed owner reads run against pinned
storage snapshots while a write commits. A search stamps the current document identity generation; if a write
commits before the search re-checks it, the search restamps and retries, and
its final attempt briefly holds off writers so it always completes. A read
with a caller-pinned `identity_read_generation` that has gone stale is
rejected with `ANTFLY_INVALID_ARGUMENT` rather than retried.

A handle value is an opaque id for a slot in a process-wide registry, not a
pointer to the database. Registry slots are never freed and each carries a
generation, so every handle value a caller passes is safe to use at any time:

- `antfly_db_close` claims the slot, rejects new calls, waits for every call
  that has already entered (including calls still waiting for a lock), then
  frees the database and advances the slot's generation.
- A call racing close, or made after it, returns `ANTFLY_INVALID_ARGUMENT`
  instead of touching freed memory. This holds even for a thread paused
  before its call reached the handle.
- Concurrent and repeated `antfly_db_close` calls are no-ops after the first.
- A slot reused by a later open gets a new generation, so an old handle value
  can never reach the new database. A slot that has used every generation a
  handle value can encode is retired for the life of the process instead of
  wrapping, so generations never repeat.

On 64-bit POSIX targets a handle value is also a genuine address inside an
inaccessible region the library reserves (no memory is committed), so it is
at least 4096, aligned, and never inside any allocator's heap. Bindings can
therefore keep it in pointer-typed fields that a garbage collector inspects,
such as Go's `unsafe.Pointer`.

This is stronger than `sqlite3_close`, where using a closed connection is
undefined. Bindings may still track their own handle state to report a
closed handle before crossing the ABI.

Lite embedded handles are independent connections. Any number of writable,
read-only, and status-only connections may remain open to the same file.
Opening an existing file does not reserve its writer. Complete native operations
queue on a canonical file gate within a process, and a kernel path lease
coordinates operations between processes. A writable operation owns the lease
through its durable publication; SQL COMMIT retains it through the complete
coordinator/participant recovery boundary. A competing process returns
`ANTFLY_BUSY`, or waits up to `busy_timeout_ms`. Read-only calls use a shared
lease. Calls on writable connections currently use an exclusive lease even
for reads, a conservative policy that serializes those calls across processes.
Read-only snapshots without a lock sidecar also open from read-only directories
or media. Their calls use a shared inode fence when sidecar creation is denied;
every sidecar creator takes the exclusive inode fence before installing it.
Reopened native writers discover pending generated enrichment in the durable
journals of all tables and resume it under their connection lease.

After an external commit or atomic file replacement, a connection reopens its
cached runtime before the next operation. Streaming SQL cursors retain the
runtime and immutable pages they originally pinned; retiring that runtime
releases caches without flushing them over a newer generation. Read-only
connections observe new commits at operation boundaries. Automatic enrichment,
TTL, and reclamation maintenance run under the same connection lease.

This follows SQLite's separation of connection lifetime from writer ownership;
it does not claim SQLite WAL concurrency or change Antfly SQL's existing
READ COMMITTED transaction semantics. Low-level storage owners used by the
standalone CLI/server retain their exclusive owner contract; a connection waits
for an active owner at operation time, not at open time.

Every thread that calls into `libantfly` needs at least
`ANTFLY_MIN_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` (8 MiB) of native stack. The storage engine
keeps sizable buffers on the stack: release builds peak around 2 MiB and
debug builds use more, and a smaller stack crashes inside the engine rather
than returning an error. 8 MiB is the Linux and macOS main-thread default,
but secondary threads are often smaller: macOS pthreads default to 512 KiB
and Rust `std` threads to 2 MiB. How each binding meets the minimum:

| Binding | How it gets the minimum |
|---|---|
| Go | cgo calls run on OS threads that inherit the 8 MiB main-thread stack |
| Python | CPython threads use 8 MiB (Linux) or 16 MiB (macOS) |
| Rust | caller's responsibility; spawn threads with `antfly_embedded::MIN_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` |
| TypeScript | configures koffi's call stacks to 8 MiB before loading the library |
| C | size threads with `pthread_attr_setstacksize(&attr, ANTFLY_MIN_THREAD_STACK_SIZE)` |

The Rust binding's tests run at exactly the minimum, so stack growth in the
engine fails them.

Handles must not be carried across `fork()`: close them before forking or
open new ones in the child. The library may run background enrichment and
maintenance work on its own threads for non-hosted handles; hosted handles
leave that work to explicit run-until-idle calls.

## Lite File Operations

The `antfly_lite_*` functions are not a separate Lite ABI. Besides the open
shortcuts, they cover only operations on the `.aflite` format itself:

- Integrity checks (`antfly_lite_check_json`), including path-level checks for
  files that may not open (`antfly_lite_check_file_json`).
- Physical stable snapshots of the file (`antfly_lite_copy_stable_snapshot_json`,
  `antfly_lite_copy_stable_snapshot_file_json`).
- Compaction and vacuum of the file (`antfly_lite_compact_json`,
  `antfly_lite_vacuum_json`).

Everything else, including status, backup, import, restore, drains, and
generated-enrichment replay, is storage-neutral and named `antfly_db_*` or
`antfly_*`.

## Testing Expectations

C ABI changes should have coverage for:

- Header/library size agreement for options structs.
- Prefix-compatible options parsing.
- Unknown flag and non-zero reserved-field rejection.
- Generic directory open, Lite open, create, read-only reopen, and write
  rejection.
- Physical read-only behavior for persistent backends.
- Binding smoke tests that compile against the installed public header.
- Every new export that takes a handle must enter through `enterHandle` with
  the right access class, and a binding test should run it concurrently with
  writes (see `go/pkg/embedded/concurrency_cgo_test.go`).

## Database SQL

ABI 3 makes SQL database-scoped: `antfly_db_sql_json(db, request, out)` resolves
tables from a durable catalog. `antfly_db_create_table_json`, `drop_table`,
`list_tables_json`, and SQL CREATE/DROP TABLE manage independent table
namespaces. Tables own their schemas, indexes, enrichment configuration, and
document identities. Dropped IDs are never reused. The root document API
addresses the catalog's `default` table; quote it as `"default"` in SQL.

`antfly_db_open_table` returns a handle accepted by the document, schema,
index, enrichment, graph, and search APIs. Table handles share the owning
database's API fence and never own the file runtime. Close them with
`antfly_db_close` before dropping their table. Closing the database drains
entered calls, invalidates its table handles, and releases all sessions and
cursors. Database SQL/catalog/session operations require the database handle.

Portable `.afb` archives contain the complete embedded database: its live
table catalog, schemas, documents, index and enrichment definitions, stored
artifacts, and UNIQUE/FK constraint state. Export and import require the
database handle. Import requires an empty database without open table handles,
SQL sessions, or cursors. Restore builds every table in an unpublished
file or directory generation before atomically publishing the whole database.
Table IDs and the next-ID counter survive restoration; dropped namespaces
are excluded. A SHA-256 digest covers the complete database archive.

Embedded SQL catalog DDL uses the shared schema translator and native schema
publication. `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] name ON table (...)`
supports expression keys, direction/null ordering, INCLUDE columns and partial
WHERE predicates. `DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] name [ON table]` removes the index
and its paired SQL uniqueness constraint. Without ON, the name must identify
one table; ambiguity returns SQLSTATE 42725. DDL runs outside explicit
transactions. Declaration changes increment the schema version through a
compare-and-swap and return a receipt with the native build/validation state.
`ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT ...` retries failed coverage through the
native guarded retry protocol without changing the schema version. Constraint
activation uses the same bounded, guarded worker as the server. UNIQUE removal
fences and drains the native claims with durable retirement checkpoints;
interrupted retirement resumes before the next embedded operation. Foreign keys
that own a retiring UNIQUE generation prevent admission; another equivalent
UNIQUE can be dropped if it is not the selected foreign-key target. A pending
receipt means the operation was durably admitted; inspect the schema and native
status rather than replaying it.

CHECK expressions also accept typed `IN` and `NOT IN` membership lists,
including NULL items and other supported scalar expressions. Membership uses
SQL three-valued logic and stops at the first match. SQL queries support
`strpos(text, substring)`, returning the first one-based Unicode character
position, zero for no match, and NULL when either argument is NULL.
`LIKE` and `ILIKE`, including their negations, accept `ESCAPE` with a single
Unicode character or an empty string to disable escaping. The default escape
is backslash. Escape expressions can be parameters; NULL produces UNKNOWN.

Partial-index predicates accept boolean columns, `NOT`, `IS [NOT] TRUE/FALSE`,
and conjunctions of typed column/literal comparisons and NULL tests. Boolean
shorthand shares the native equality predicates used by explicit comparisons.
Negated truth tests retain NULL rows through native null-safe distinctness;
`NOT flag` excludes NULL rows, while `flag IS NOT TRUE` includes them. Predicates
that require a disjunction remain unsupported by the native conjunction format.

Index creation advances bounded native build pages before reporting readiness.
Large builds can return pending and resume through Lite maintenance or an
explicit `run_until_idle`, which drains relational indexes as well as search
indexes. MATCH PARTIAL FK publication requires ready parent support indexes;
a readiness deadline expires before any FK publication decision is admitted.
Admission builds only the selected witness indexes; unrelated builds and
reclamation do not consume its deadline. Lite background maintenance advances
one relational index page per table and releases the writer lease between
turns, retaining pending work for subsequent turns.

Failed UNIQUE coverage admits constraint-checked UPDATE/DELETE repairs under
the exact native activation checkpoint, including SQL transactions with cascades and multiple repair targets.
Repair admission follows the complete mutation closure, including failed tables
first reached by CASCADE or SET NULL. Read-only FK parents retain their coverage
requirements, and every cascaded postimage still obeys its declared constraints.
Every repair target retains its failed native checkpoint guard; other participants
still require completed UNIQUE coverage. After repairing the rows, VALIDATE
CONSTRAINT resumes historical coverage. FK activation waits for parent UNIQUE
coverage without blocking reads or parent repairs.
FK-bearing CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT publish accepted
child generations at each parent before installing the child schema. DROP TABLE
retires its outgoing FK generations before removing the namespace. These native
owner transitions share a durable root publication plan; reopen or the next API
call completes an interrupted plan before admitting more work. Recreating a
table registers its fresh identity and FK generations rather than reusing old
references or parent admission state.

`antfly_search('table', request [, candidate_limit])` is a SQL relation. The
table name is a literal so preparation can derive its columns; request is text
or a text parameter containing the same public query JSON used by search_json.
Plain query text uses the full-text query-string parser. JSON supports named
indexes, filters, highlights, explicit dense/sparse embeddings, configured
semantic embedders and hybrid fusion. The optional candidate limit overrides
the JSON limit (1–10000), and may be written as `limit => 50`. SQL LIMIT applies
after joins and filters; it does not expand the search candidate window.

The relation exposes the declared table columns plus `_id`, nullable `score`
and nullable JSON `_highlights`. `score` and `_highlights` are reserved in a
search relation; conflicting declarations are rejected. All participating
native tables are fenced together while search hits are ranked/hydrated and
other scans capture snapshots. Cursors retain this statement view across
fetches. Embedding resolution happens before capture. SQL search rejects
uncommitted writes to the searched table because native indexes cannot rank
staged rows; commit those writes first. Other session postimages remain
available to ordinary table scans.
Relational hits are hydrated from the retained native typed-row snapshot,
preserving SQL NULL separately from JSON null. Document hydration preserves
JSON number tokens, including decimals and integers beyond float precision.

```sql
SELECT t.id, s._id, s.score
FROM antfly_search('history_items', $1, 50) s
JOIN threads t ON t.id = s.thread_id
WHERE t.project_id = $2 AND NOT t.archived
ORDER BY s.score DESC, s._id
LIMIT 20;
```

SQL requests contain `statement`, positional `parameters`, a materialized
result `limit` (default 128, maximum 4096), and optional `session_id`.
Sessions are independent connection contexts created by `sql_session_open`.
BEGIN defaults to READ COMMITTED. COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO,
and RELEASE are supported; stronger isolation and transactional DDL are
rejected. Statements read a pinned native snapshot plus their session's staged
postimages. Session writes remain private until COMMIT, which prepares native
version predicates and relational integrity commands across all affected
tables. Cross-table joins and foreign keys use the same native catalog.
Closing a session abandons staged writes. Failed transactions reject further
data statements until ROLLBACK or ROLLBACK TO an existing savepoint.

The root namespace persists the native transaction's durable decision.
Interrupted preparation is aborted on recovery; decided commits finish
participant intent resolution without replaying SQL. A committed-pending
outcome remains committed. An unknown decision returns SQLSTATE 40003 and a
transaction receipt; do not replay it. Close and reopen the database to
recover/reconcile that receipt. Commit responses reserve a fallback buffer
before mutation, so response allocation cannot erase a committed outcome.

`sql_open_cursor_json` pins a read statement without a total row limit.
`sql_fetch_cursor_json` returns `{result, exhausted}` in pages of 1–4096
rows. Close cursors explicitly, including after early termination. Unsupported
streaming plans return 0A000 and may use the bounded materialized API;
materialized result overflow returns an error. Session close releases its
cursors. `sql_describe_json` binds column and parameter types without executing.
SQL buffers include structured diagnostics on failure and must always be
freed. Integer cells are decimal strings, preserving exact signed 64-bit
values; `sql_nulls` distinguishes SQL NULL from a JSON null value.

The bindings provide Go `database/sql` (`antfly`, `file:/path/app.aflite`),
Python `antfly_embedded.dbapi`, Rust's optional `sqlx` feature, and TypeScript
`Connection` / `@antfly/embedded/kysely`. Their shared SQL conformance inputs
are in `pkg/antfly-embedded/capi-conformance/sql/cases.json`.

SQL JSON requests admit at most 64 MiB (67,108,864 bytes), including source
text and parameter data. Larger requests return a structured SQLSTATE `54000`
diagnostic naming that limit, including when a SQL session is active.
Preparation and execution each default to 256 MiB (268,435,456 bytes) of
working memory; decoding, staged rows and storage representations can coexist.
Requests below the wire limit can still exhaust working memory. Token, node
and nesting limits independently bound syntax. Embedded SQL sessions admit
4,096 staged mutations and 256 MiB of staging memory; native transaction
intent admission additionally counts retained payload and metadata, with its
configured transaction-byte limit (128 MiB by default). Nested OFFSET queries and derived-table
window functions grow retained storage with observed rows and may spill to disk.

## Native SDK validation

The Zig validation workflow installs `libantfly` alongside the E2E binary and
shares its complete `lib/` and `include/` installation with the Go, Rust, Python,
and TypeScript native SDK jobs. SDK source changes also admit this build. The
E2E aggregate gates require those jobs to pass; the fast SDK checks remain
available independently. Native jobs require the installed library and cannot
pass by skipping tests when it is missing.

Run the same checks locally with:

```sh
scripts/ci/test-embedded-sdk-native.sh /path/to/libantfly-install all
```

The optional final argument selects `go`, `rust`, `python`, or `typescript`.
The runner includes Rust's embedded SQLx integration. Model-dependent inference
suites are excluded by default; set `ANTFLY_SDK_NATIVE_INFERENCE=1` to include
them after installing their required models. This is separate from the remote
PostgreSQL driver matrix in `scripts/test_pgwire_drivers.py`.
