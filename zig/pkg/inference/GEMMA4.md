# Gemma 4

This note tracks Antfly inference's Gemma 4 generation support, especially Google's
Gemma 4 Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) assistant models.

## Current Status

Antfly inference supports Gemma 4 as a native decoder family through the shared GPT
runtime. The model config already carries Gemma 4-specific metadata such as
sliding/global attention, shared KV-tail metadata, grouped-query dimensions,
per-layer embeddings (PLE), MoE metadata, and final logit softcapping.

For MTP, Antfly inference has a generic native speculative decoding path:

1. A draft model proposes up to `speculative_k` tokens.
2. The target model verifies the drafted span in one forward pass.
3. Matching draft tokens are accepted.
4. On the first mismatch, the target's token is accepted instead.
5. If all drafted tokens match, the target supplies one bonus token.

This is exposed through the server API with `draft_model` and `speculative_k`.
The CLI also supports it:

```sh
antfly inference generate /path/to/google/gemma-4-E2B-it \
  "Explain speculative decoding in one paragraph." \
  --draft-model /path/to/google/gemma-4-E2B-it-assistant \
  --speculative-k 4 \
  --speculation-policy auto \
  --speculation-calibration positive \
  --backend metal \
  --print-timing
```

Calibrated auto policy requires `--speculation-calibration positive`; CLI
calibration otherwise defaults to `none`, which does not activate Gemma 4 MTP
auto mode. Metal auto policy is also runtime-default-off; set
`ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_ENABLE_METAL_AUTO=1` to evaluate it. The inherited adaptive
cap (`k=2`) and acceptance threshold remain unchanged.

Branch-added Metal MTP accelerators remain explicit rollout opt-ins until
current model-level token-parity and runtime evidence is checked in:

- `ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_DEFER_MATERIALIZE=1` and
  `ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_DEFER_MATERIALIZE_TARGET_ACTIVATION=1` enable deferred
  correction/bonus materialization and target-activation reuse.
- `ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_ACCEPT_BONUS=1` enables Metal bonus-token acceptance;
  CUDA and native retain their inherited default.
- `TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_GEMMA4_MTP_VERIFY_TAIL_FRAME=1` enables the prepared
  verify-tail LM-head/argmax frame.
- `TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_DONATED_SLOT_ATTENTION_ON_FRAME=1` enables direct
  donated-KV slot attention on the draft frame. The inherited
  `TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_DONATED_SLOT_ATTENTION=1` remains the master rollback.
- `TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_Q6_K_R2_REDUCE=1` and
  `TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_SMALL_ROWS_NORM_REDUCE=1` enable the small-row MTP
  verify kernels. Their corresponding `DISABLE_` variables override opt-ins.
- `TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_Q4_0_PAIR_ACTIVATION_SMALL_BATCH=1` enables the
  rows-2-to-8 shared-read gate/up kernel; its `DISABLE_` variable overrides it.
- `ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_ENABLE_METAL_PREFILL_HIDDEN_CAPTURE=1` enables the
  prepared-tail prefill/hidden-state handoff; its `DISABLE_` variable overrides
  it.

The hand-written Metal chunked flash-prefill path is enabled with
`TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_PREFILL_SG_ATTENTION=1`; its contiguous direct K/V load
requires `TERMITE_METAL_ENABLE_PREFILL_SG_DIRECT_LOAD=1`. Both passed the E4B
long-prompt token gate, but remain opt-in because the Metal runtime switch is
process-wide rather than scoped to the loaded model. Their matching `DISABLE_`
variables remain rollback overrides.

The baseline M4 Metal path also has three independently reversible policies:

- Sliding-window attention clamps the generated flash kernel's K/V scan to the
  live window by default. `TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_SWA_SCAN_CLAMP=1` restores the
  full logical-history scan. The choice is captured once when each Metal
  runtime is created, so concurrent model runtimes cannot race on policy state.
- Prepared single-token decode frames use retained-reference command buffers
  on qualified Apple M4 devices. `TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_FAST_PREPARED_FRAME=1`
  restores the diagnostic-safe command-buffer path, and
  `TERMITE_METAL_FORCE_DIAGNOSTIC_COMMAND_BUFFERS=1` forces that path whenever
  profiling or debugging requires it.
- Q4_0 row-one matvec dispatch selects a device/shape-qualified threadgroup
  portfolio. `TERMITE_METAL_Q4_0_MMV_VARIANT=auto|legacy|nr4-nsg2|nr8-nsg2|nr4-nsg4|nr8-nsg4`
  provides deterministic qualification overrides, while
  `TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_Q4_0_MMV_PORTFOLIO=1` is the master rollback to the
  legacy selector.

Singleton intermediate Gemma 4 prefill chunks use the planned Metal frame by
default. `TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_SINGLETON_SCHEDULED_PREFILL_FRAME=1` restores
the scheduled mixed-context path for diagnosis. Final logits and MTP hidden
capture never use the planned intermediate-chunk frame.

The typed KV policy stores Gemma 4 sliding-attention layers in a fixed Metal
ring while global-attention layers retain full KV history. The ring is disabled
for prompt-cache requests, cache compaction, and non-paged attention;
`TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_SPLIT_SWA_KV_RING=1` is the master rollback while the
long-context rollout gate remains experimental.

The drafter must use the same tokenizer vocabulary and special token ids as the
target. Speculative decoding is currently native text-only generation; it is not
enabled for multimodal prompts or the ONNX direct path.

## Chat REPL

`antfly inference chat` is the ollama-style interactive path: it resolves a
friendly model name, pulls the model from HuggingFace when missing, loads it,
and starts a multi-turn REPL:

```sh
antfly inference chat gemma4-e2b
```

`gemma4-e2b` and `gemma4-e4b` (plus `gemma-4-*` and `*-it` spellings) resolve
to Google's official QAT conversions `google/gemma-4-*-it-qat-q4_0-gguf` — the
checkpoints production workflows already run on; any `owner/name[:variant]`
reference or local model directory also works. The REPL
supports `/set`, `/show`, `/clear`, `"""` multi-line input, and Ctrl-C to stop
a response without leaving the chat (see `antfly inference chat --help`).

Chat can keep the model's `PromptPrefixCache` active across turns with a fresh
paged decode state per turn (`--prompt-cache`), so turn N+1 only prefills the
previous reply plus the new user message; the per-turn footer reports the
reused prefix as `N cached`. The flag is **opt-in and currently experimental**:
attaching a cached prefix reproducibly degrades the attached tokens' KV on
metal (temp-0 A/B: the model loses early-prompt context and asks clarifying
questions instead of answering) and can hang generation on the native backend.
Suspected area: block-hash cache entries carry per-block
`storage_block_id: ?KvBlockId` while only the simple-mode attach re-attaches
retained storage blocks (`attachSequenceWithRetainedBlocks`,
`runtime/kv/prompt_cache.zig`). Until that attach path is fixed, chat defaults
to full re-prefill each turn. Chat is target-only generation: no MTP assistant is pulled or used
because speculative decoding disables prompt-prefix reuse (the
`!use_speculative` eligibility gate in `pipelines/generation.zig`) and forfeits
the multi-turn TTFT win. Use `generate --draft-model` for the speculative path.

### Sampling performance and temperature

Sampled decoding (temperature > 0, chat's default is 0.7) runs through the
backend-owned sampled decoder frame
(`decoder_gated_runtime.forwardSampledToken`: device-resident Gumbel/top-k
sampling with a prepared sampled tail), the same fused frame family as greedy
decoding. Reference numbers on an M4 Pro with the E2B QAT q4_0 checkpoint:
~52 tok/s sampled, ~80 tok/s greedy. Before this wiring, non-greedy configs
fell off the fused frame onto the per-op eager path (~5 tok/s), and the host
sampler's top-k/top-p were O(k·vocab) rescans — both are fixed, so do not
"optimize" chat by forcing temperature 0 for speed.

One temperature note for the QAT checkpoints: at temperature >= 0.7 the model
sometimes spends its whole turn in the thought channel and ends without a
public reply (chat prints an explicit notice instead of a blank response);
temperature 0-0.3 transitions to the public answer reliably.

### Channel transition conventions

The final-channel projection accepts two observed checkpoint conventions for
the thought→public transition:

1. The explicit `<|channel>final\n<channel|>` header (Harmony style). When a
   stream contains this header anywhere, it wins and streaming emits deltas
   live from the header onward.
2. A bare `<channel|>` that closes the prompt-opened private channel with no
   replacement header — the GGUF conversions (Google QAT and ggml-org) emit
   only this form. It is accepted **only when no explicit header exists in the
   stream** (`bareChannelCloseRange` in `pipelines/generation.zig`), so a
   bare close inside a header-emitting stream cannot leak private content.
   Streaming cannot look ahead for the header-absence proof, so bare-close
   streams surface their text once at end of turn via `GenerationResult.text`
   rather than token-by-token; the CLI and chat REPL both print that fallback.

Explicitly opened non-final channels stay private under both conventions, and
a stream with no recognized transition still projects to empty output.

## Google Gemma 4 MTP Design

Google's MTP assistants are not just arbitrary smaller language models. They
are paired with a target Gemma 4 checkpoint and are designed to reduce drafting
overhead:

- The assistant shares the target input embedding table.
- The assistant consumes target last-layer activations.
- The assistant concatenates target activations with token embeddings and
  down-projects into the drafter width.
- The assistant can share target-side KV/cache state instead of recomputing the
  whole prompt independently.
- E2B and E4B assistants include an efficient clustered embedder to avoid a
  full-vocabulary projection for every draft step.

## Source and Artifact Confirmation

Sources checked on 2026-05-05:

- Google's launch post and Hugging Face model cards describe Gemma 4 MTP as
  assisted/speculative decoding: an assistant proposes multiple tokens, and the
  target model verifies them in parallel while preserving target quality.
- Hugging Face exposes `google/gemma-4-*-assistant` as Transformers
  `AutoModelForCausalLM` artifacts, with `generation_config.json` marking
  `"is_assistant": true`, `"num_assistant_tokens": 6`, and a constant assistant
  token schedule.
- The public Transformers `v5.7.0` and `v5.8.0` Gemma 4 source does not expose
  `Gemma4AssistantForCausalLM` or `gemma4_assistant` implementation details.
  The public source trail for runtime behavior is currently LiteRT-LM, not the
  tagged Transformers Gemma 4 model files.
- LiteRT-LM's MTP drafter runtime loads a `tf_lite_mtp_drafter` model section,
  uses a base-model `verify` signature, and drafts greedily. It concatenates
  token embeddings with the verifier/base activations into an `activations`
  input, runs the drafter repeatedly, and verifies `G + 1` target positions in
  one pass. On mismatch it accepts the verifier token; on full match it accepts
  the verifier bonus token.

Confirmed assistant artifact structure:

- `antfly inference pull google/gemma-4-E2B-it-assistant` downloads the official
  safetensors assistant into
  `~/.antfly/inference/models/google/gemma-4-E2B-it-assistant`.
- `google/gemma-4-E2B-it-assistant` config:
  - `architectures`: `Gemma4AssistantForCausalLM`
  - `model_type`: `gemma4_assistant`
  - `backbone_hidden_size`: 1536
  - compact text stack: 4 layers, hidden size 256, 4 attention heads, 1 KV head,
    sliding attention for layers 0-2 and full attention for layer 3
  - `use_ordered_embeddings`: true, `num_centroids`: 2048,
    `centroid_intermediate_top_k`: 32
- E2B assistant safetensors header:
  - `pre_projection.weight`: `[256, 3072]`
  - `post_projection.weight`: `[1536, 256]`
  - `model.embed_tokens.weight`: `[262144, 256]`
  - `masked_embedding.token_ordering`: `[262144]`
  - `masked_embedding.centroids.weight`: `[2048, 256]`
- E4B assistant safetensors header:
  - `pre_projection.weight`: `[256, 5120]`
  - `post_projection.weight`: `[2560, 256]`
  - otherwise follows the E2B compact 256-wide, 4-layer drafter shape
- 26B-A4B assistant safetensors header:
  - `pre_projection.weight`: `[1024, 5632]`
  - `post_projection.weight`: `[2816, 1024]`
  - `model.embed_tokens.weight`: `[262144, 1024]`
  - no `masked_embedding.*` tensors in the inspected safetensors header

The projection shapes confirm LiteRT-LM's runtime contract: MTP drafter input is
`concat(token_embedding, verifier_or_target_activation)` at
`2 * backbone_hidden_size`, the compact assistant stack runs at its own hidden
size, and `post_projection` returns to target/backbone hidden size for the next
chained draft step.

Runtime findings from implementation:

- The assistant is query-only. It owns Q/O projections and MLP weights, but no
  K/V projections. All assistant layers must read target K/V banks.
- The 4 assistant layers do not map to target layers 0-3. They map by attention
  type to the target's last non-shared KV donor layers:
  - E2B target: sliding donor layer 13, full-attention donor layer 14.
  - E4B community LiteRT extraction reports the analogous banks as layers 22
    and 23.
- E2B/E4B `masked_embedding.token_ordering` is a full vocabulary permutation,
  and `masked_embedding.centroids.weight` is `[2048, 256]`. This supports a
  clustered output head: score centroids, keep the configured top 32 centroid
  groups, then select the best token inside those groups from assistant
  embedding logits.
- The official E2B assistant config says `tie_word_embeddings = true` and does
  not include an explicit `lm_head.weight`; the current implementation uses the
  assistant embedding matrix for logits, then applies the clustered mask when
  `masked_embedding.*` tensors are present.
- MLX-VLM's public Gemma 4 assistant implementation and the SeatownSin
  extracted PyTorch drafter both highlight runtime details that are easy to get
  subtly wrong:
  - the target activation passed to the drafter is the target hidden state that
    predicted the current token, not the hidden state after consuming that
    token;
  - the drafter position id is held constant during an autoregressive MTP draft
    block.
- The extracted PyTorch drafter captures the output of `text_model.norm`, so
  Antfly inference now uses final-RMSNorm target hidden states for both target logits and
  MTP drafter handoff. The older pre-final-RMSNorm handoff is retained only as
  implementation scaffolding for comparison.
- The public `masked_embedder.py` implementation treats
  `masked_embedding.token_ordering` as centroid-to-token ordering:
  `ordering[c * cluster_size .. (c + 1) * cluster_size]` is the token set for
  centroid `c`. That matches the current baseline implementation; the inverse
  interpretation is now only a debug experiment.

The current Antfly inference implementation uses the same acceptance/verification
algorithm. Phase 1 used an independent decoder drafter. Phase 2 now has a
Gemma-specific MTP draft step that consumes target hidden activations, reads
target K/V, and chains projected activations. Verification is still target-owned.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Generic Assistant Drafters

Status: implemented for the native server API and CLI.

- Load an optional `draft_model` alongside the target model.
- Validate tokenizer compatibility before generation.
- Allocate a separate draft KV manager and decode state.
- Prefill target and draft with the same text prompt.
- Run the existing draft/verify speculative loop.
- Report speculative rounds, drafted tokens, accepted draft tokens, rejected
  draft tokens, corrections, and bonus tokens in CLI timing output.
- Disable direct ONNX and one-token artifact shortcuts when a drafter is
  requested so generation cannot silently ignore the assistant.

This should work with Gemma 4 `*-assistant` checkpoints if they are exported in
a format the native loader understands as a decoder-only model.

### Phase 2: Gemma 4 MTP Runtime

Status: implemented with Gemma-specific runtime ownership and remaining
acceptance-rate investigation.

Add a Gemma-specific drafter runtime that understands assistant checkpoints as
MTP heads instead of independent decoders:

1. Extend model metadata parsing for MTP assistant structure: done.
   - `model_type = "gemma4_assistant"` and
     `architectures = ["Gemma4AssistantForCausalLM"]`,
   - `backbone_hidden_size`,
   - assistant layer count and hidden size,
   - `pre_projection.weight` and `post_projection.weight`,
   - clustered embedder metadata for E2B/E4B where present,
   - explicit target-model compatibility identifiers when available.
2. Expose target drafter activations from the target decode pass: done for
   native generation through `forwardAllLogitsAndHiddenHost` and
   `materializeAcceptedTokenKvAndReturnHidden`. The MTP path uses final
   RMSNorm hidden for the drafter handoff, matching the extracted PyTorch
   reference's `text_model.norm` hook.
3. Add a Gemma 4 MTP draft helper in `src/architectures/gemma4_mtp.zig`: done.
   - borrow or alias target token embeddings at the target/backbone width,
   - consume target final hidden activations,
   - build drafter inputs from `concat(token_embedding, target_hidden)`,
   - run the assistant transformer stack,
   - produce assistant logits and clustered candidate logits,
   - retain the drafter's `projected_activations`/post-projection output so the
     next draft step can chain from the prior assistant step without rerunning
     the target.
4. Replace independent draft prompt prefill with target-activation seeding: done
   for `gemma4_assistant` draft configs.
5. Keep the existing verification path unchanged: done. Target-side verification is
   what preserves output quality and sampling semantics.
6. Extend telemetry: partially done. `ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_DEBUG=1` prints drafted
   token ids and verifier choices for acceptance debugging.
7. Move Gemma 4 runtime-specific construction into
   `src/architectures/gemma4_runtime.zig`: done.
   - the explicit backend contract is `gemma4_gated_ple_shared_kv`,
   - shared-KV layer specs, PLE slots, head-norm slots, and final/tail slots are
     built by the Gemma 4 architecture module,
   - per-layer output scales are resolved to scalar runtime metadata for the
     whole-frame path instead of retained backend tensors,
   - Gemma 4 MTP assistants skip standalone shared-decoder prewarm so valid
     assistant artifacts no longer emit the stale `MissingWeight` warning.

Current smoke result:

```sh
antfly inference generate ~/.antfly/inference/models/ggml-org/gemma-4-e2b-it-gguf \
  "Write one short sentence about databases." \
  --backend metal \
  --draft-model ~/.antfly/inference/models/google/gemma-4-E2B-it-assistant \
  --speculative-k 2 \
  --max-tokens 4 \
  --print-token-ids \
  --print-timing
```

This runs end-to-end and preserves target-owned verification. After fixing the
activation handoff to use the hidden state that predicted the current token, the
same short smoke accepted one draft token:

```text
speculative: rounds=2 drafted=4 matched=1 rejected=3 accepted=3 corrections=2 bonus=0
```

A longer `--speculative-k 6 --max-tokens 12` smoke accepted 2 of 41 drafted
tokens against the local `ggml-org` Q8_0 GGUF target. The runtime is now
productive, but acceptance is still far below the published best-case numbers.
The remaining likely causes are source/model pairing differences between the
official safetensors assistant and the local GGUF target, quantization effects in
the target, or a still-missing detail in the clustered output head.

### CUDA Branch Status

CUDA MTP remains experimental. Its diagnostics are not a production-readiness
certification and are not a paired llama.cpp comparison; no throughput result
from that path should be described as superiority over llama.cpp. The CUDA
release contract covers target-only Gemma 4 QAT, while strict MTP certification
and promotion remain follow-up work.

Update 2026-07-13 on branch `codex/quant-kernel-metal-compiler`: the quant
kernel compiler ships 5 promoted generated CUDA Q4_0 artifacts as runtime
opt-ins for the Gemma4 QAT path (`antfly_q4_0_mmv_f32_v1`,
`antfly_q4_0_mm_f32_v1`,
`antfly_q4_0_pair_mmv_f32_v1`, plus the q8_1/DP4A pair
`antfly_q4_0_pair_activation_q8_1_mmv_v1` and
`antfly_q4_0_down_q8_1_mmv_v1` inside the opt-in
`ANTFLY_INFERENCE_CUDA_Q4_0_GATE_UP_ACTIVATION_Q8_1_PRECOMPUTE` tuned path).
Measured on E2B QAT (`gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf`, 128 tokens,
NVIDIA L4) versus the handwritten routes: prefill 150 ms vs 200 ms
(about -25%), decode about +2.4%, bit-identical output, zero fallbacks.
Measured on E4B QAT in the tuned llama.cpp pair-harness config: E2E median
8197 ms vs 8370 ms with the q8_1 kernels disabled (about -2.1%), decode 63.4
vs about 61.5 tok/s; the paired margin vs llama.cpp roughly halved. Launch
counts appear in `--print-timing`/`--json-timing` as
`cuda_q4_0_generated_counts:`. Enable one route at a time with
`ANTFLY_INFERENCE_CUDA_GENERATED_Q4_0_{MMV,MM,PAIR,PAIR_Q8,DOWN_Q8}=1` for
model-level validation. The matching per-kernel `DISABLE_` variables override
the opt-in; `ANTFLY_INFERENCE_CUDA_DISABLE_GENERATED_Q4_0=1` disables every
generated Q4_0 route and candidate.
Details and promotion evidence: `QUANT_KERNEL_COMPILER.md` (Current CUDA
State).

Update 2026-07-31 on branch `quant-kernel-long-context`: ten-pair warm-server
long-context evidence (2,051-token prompt, 300 greedy tokens, F16 K/V, L4)
puts the tuned frontier profile at 740.8 ms TTFT and 110.2 decode tokens/s
versus llama.cpp at 329.5 ms and 114.4 tokens/s, a 1.173 total-latency ratio —
decode is within 4% and prefill projections remain the whole gap. This is not
a superiority result. See `docs/CUDA_TUNING.md` ("Gemma 4 E2B SM89
optimization status") for the paired statistics, the promoted-routes-only
measurement, and the F32-cache decode caveat.

Update 2026-07-31 (flash-prefill promotion): the SM89 GQA flash-prefill F16
composites (`attention_prefill_flash_sm89_hd{256,512}`) are promoted to
production runtime defaults. With `ANTFLY_INFERENCE_CUDA_GQA_PREFILL_PROFILE`
unset, the runtime resolves an automatic selector that engages
`flash-f16-sm89` whenever the qualified contract holds (SM89, page-16 paged
F16 K/V, GQA 8:1, q512/q3 query-length policy, matching sliding-window/global
geometry, symbols loaded) and otherwise silently keeps the previous unset
launch topology. Promotion evidence: `zig build
quant-kernel-cuda-paged-prefill-diff` passed all 90
guard/page-table/adversarial/determinism cases bitwise-identical (also run in
CI on the L4 lane). Rollback: `ANTFLY_INFERENCE_CUDA_GQA_PREFILL_PROFILE=off`;
all explicit profile values behave exactly as before.

Update 2026-08-01 (W4A16 tensor-core prefill projections promoted): non-perturbing
nsys profiling showed prefill is GPU-bound (99.7% device utilization — the earlier
"host overhead" was un-bucketed GPU kernels, not host idle), with the FFN gate/up
projection (`termite_linear_q4_0_pair_nobias_q8_1_f32_tile4`, DP4A/SIMT int8) the
single dominant kernel at ~52% of prefill. Routing Q4_0 prefill projections through
the BF16 tensor-core (WMMA) kernel instead cuts prefill 1.81x (2297->1269 ms on a
1131-token chunked run) AND raises quality: vs the F32-activation reference the BF16
tensor-core path matches 96/96 greedy tokens (100%) while the DP4A q8_1 default
matches only 30/96 (31%, diverges at token 29) — bf16 activations track f32's argmax;
q8_1 int8 is too coarse. `q4_0_tc_hmma_prefill` is therefore promoted default-on for
SM89 (compute 8.9): W4A16 handles prefill projections (rows>1); DP4A stays for decode
(rows==1). Rollback: `ANTFLY_INFERENCE_CUDA_Q4_0_TC_HMMA_PREFILL=0`.

Status checked on 2026-06-21 on branch `gemma4_gpu_stuff`:

- `zig build -Dcuda=true` succeeds.
- `antfly-inference cuda-info --smoke` succeeds on an NVIDIA L4 (`sm_89`).
- The CUDA smoke now covers the Gemma4-specific WIP primitives:
  add-multiply-scalar, RMSNorm-add-multiply-scalar, head-norm+RoPE, GQA, RoPE,
  and MTP masked argmax.
- Local validation artifacts used in this pass:
  `.models/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-GGUF/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf`
  for E2B CUDA smoke, `.models/google/gemma-4-12B-it-q4_k` for 12B Q4 CUDA
  validation, and `.models/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-GGUF/MTP/` for E2B MTP
  assistant GGUFs.
- CUDA uses the current device-side Gemma4 fast paths for Q4_K Q/K/V
  projection, Q4_K embedding lookup, fused head-norm+RoPE, device KV
  read/write, dense GQA attention, MTP masked argmax, and optional paged
  TurboQuant KV.
- CUDA TurboQuant KV status, measurements, and validation steps live in
  `CUDA.md` under "Gemma4 And TurboQuant KV Status". Gemma4 CUDA defaults remain
  `f32` KV for exactness. `--cache-dtype polar4` is the current
  production-candidate opt-in compressed-K/compressed-V path; `--cache-dtype
  turbo3` is resident and functional but still experimental.

The most direct user-facing E2B smoke is:

```sh
zig/pkg/inference/zig-out/bin/antfly-inference generate \
  .models/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-GGUF/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf \
  "Give a one sentence summary of Korean history." \
  --backend cuda \
  --max-tokens 128 \
  --print-timing \
  --print-token-count
```

If running from `zig/pkg/inference/zig-out/bin`, use the absolute model path
instead of `.models/...`; CUDA.md includes that copy-paste form.

Once the model artifacts are available, run the CUDA validation ladder in this
order:

```sh
zig build -Dcuda=true

zig/pkg/inference/zig-out/bin/antfly-inference cuda-info --smoke

zig/pkg/inference/zig-out/bin/antfly-inference cuda-info \

```

Useful CUDA/MTP isolation flags:

- `ANTFLY_CUDA_DISABLE_GEMMA4_MTP_DEVICE=1`: use the host clustered-output
  fallback instead of the CUDA MTP masked-argmax kernel.
- `ANTFLY_CUDA_ENABLE_Q4K_DECODE_FAST=1`: enable the experimental Q4_K tile8
  decode path.
- `ANTFLY_CUDA_DISABLE_HEAD_NORM_ROPE_FUSION=1`: disable fused
  head-norm+RoPE.
- `ANTFLY_CUDA_ENABLE_ADD_MUL_SCALAR_FUSION=1` and
  `ANTFLY_CUDA_ENABLE_RMSNORM_ADD_MUL_SCALAR_FUSION=1`: enable experimental
  output-scale fusions.
- `ANTFLY_GEMMA4_MTP_ALLOW_UNSHARED_TARGET=1`: force experimental MTP against
  targets missing shared-KV metadata.

Follow-up smoke after adding the earlier pre-final-RMSNorm target activation
path:

```text
bundle: pkg/inference/.debug/metal-command-20260505-162324
validation: MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1, MTL_SHADER_VALIDATION=0
exit_code=0
diagnostic-reports: none
speculative: rounds=3 drafted=5 matched=0 rejected=5 accepted=3 corrections=3 bonus=0
```

This confirms the path is Metal-stable under API validation for the local repro,
but it did not improve acceptance against the quantized GGUF target. Later
source comparison with the extracted PyTorch drafter moved the handoff back to
final-RMSNorm hidden states.

Official safetensors target status:

```text
bundle: pkg/inference/.debug/metal-command-20260505-170606
validation: MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1, MTL_SHADER_VALIDATION=0
command: antfly inference generate ~/.antfly/inference/models/google/gemma-4-E2B-it hi --backend metal --max-tokens 1
exit_code=0
diagnostic-reports: none
token_ids: 239863
timing_ms: load_model=2591 generate=1330 total=3926
```

Memory note: the first Metal-only safetensors attempt preserved BF16 in the
tensor store but then expanded rank-2 BF16 weights into cached f32 host slices
and duplicated BF16 bytes for the decoder runtime. That explains the observed
multi-10GB footprint. The Metal cache now keeps BF16 rank-2 dense weights as
mmap-backed native bytes, only materializing f32 for vectors and fallback paths
that actually require host math. A traced smoke peaked around 2.6GB physical
footprint instead of the earlier 30GB+ behavior.

Official target + official assistant status:

```text
bundle: pkg/inference/.debug/metal-command-20260506-161752
validation: MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1, MTL_SHADER_VALIDATION=0
command: antfly inference generate ~/.antfly/inference/models/google/gemma-4-E2B-it hi --backend auto --draft-model ~/.antfly/inference/models/google/gemma-4-E2B-it-assistant --speculative-k 2 --max-tokens 4
exit_code=0
diagnostic-reports: none
token_ids: 10979 236888 2088 740
speculative: rounds=1 drafted=2 matched=2 rejected=0 accepted=3 corrections=0 bonus=1
```

This confirms the full Metal/safetensors target + assistant runtime runs without
Metal diagnostic reports and can accept the assistant's drafted span on the
short anchor prompt. Mixed GGUF target plus official safetensors assistant is
also supported for local smoke coverage, but acceptance-rate conclusions should
prefer official target+assistant pairs and the proper Gemma 4 chat template.

The repo smoke wrapper is
`scripts/gemma4/test_metal_gemma4_assistant_speculative.sh`. It uses `--backend auto`
by default so the normal backend selector can pick Metal when available; set
`ANTFLY_INFERENCE_GEMMA4_ASSISTANT_BACKEND=metal` to force Metal for crash/debug runs.
The official target currently needs the wrapper's default
`ANTFLY_INFERENCE_GEMMA4_ASSISTANT_HOST_BUDGET_MB=12288` and
`ANTFLY_INFERENCE_GEMMA4_ASSISTANT_COMBINED_BUDGET_MB=17408` preflight budgets.

### Metal GGUF Runtime Status

The Metal GGUF path now routes explicit compiled generation through graph
execution instead of a separate live whole-model shortcut:

```sh
antfly inference generate ~/.antfly/inference/models/ggml-org/gemma-4-e2b-it-gguf \
  hi \
  --backend metal \
  --mode compiled \
  --compiled-target whole-model \
  --max-tokens 4 \
  --print-token-ids \
  --print-timing
```

Under the graph route, Metal uses the resident decoder runtime directly for
whole-model prefill/decode. Pure greedy generation can return the selected token
without downloading full logits, so the short anchor prompt now reports
`prefill cached_logits=false greedy_token=true` and decode-side
`greedy_fallback=0`.

Validator smoke on 2026-05-07:

```

The generic quant runtime surface has been separated from the Q8_0-specific
kernel implementation. Public runtime scratch/setup exports, debug env vars,
and timing labels use `quant` names. The existing Q8_0 fused kernels remain
internal fast paths; adding Q4/K-quants should extend the quant-format dispatch
behind those generic entrypoints instead of creating more public `q80` API.
The direct whole-layer block planner now follows that shape too: it asks for a
direct quantized block format and currently selects the Q8_0 implementation
only when every participating linear slot is Q8_0. Unsupported or mixed formats
fall back through the staged generic quant linear path.
The staged FFN side can still use existing fused Metal kernels for non-Q8
families: homogeneous Q4_K, Q6_K, I2_S, TL1/TL2, Q8_0, plus mixed
Q4_K/Q5_K-down, Q4_K/Q6_K-down, and Q4_0/Q8_0-down layouts. The planner now
marks those combinations as direct-eligible instead of logging them as mixed or
unsupported before the runtime has a chance to use the fused path.
The device-resident FFN residual path follows the same generic shape: Q8_0
keeps the monolithic fused kernel, while non-Q8 formats that have staged pair
and single-stage Metal kernels compose gate/up, activation, multiply,
optional RMS norms, down projection, and residual add without leaving device
memory. That removes the old Q8-only boundary without adding format-specific
public APIs.

A standalone prepared-tail greedy shortcut that directly encoded
`rms_norm + quantized lm_head + argmax` outside a planned frame was tested and
backed out after a 2026-05-07 SoC watchdog reset under Metal API validation
(`pkg/inference/.debug/metal-command-20260507-214829`, panic
`/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Retired/panic-base-2026-05-07-214909.panic`).
Keep that path on the materialized-logits argmax route until the command
lifetime/barrier issue is isolated. After reverting, minimal API-validation
smoke `pkg/inference/.debug/metal-command-20260507-215452` completed with
`token_ids: 10979` and no new diagnostic reports.

The native Metal GGUF route must not depend on MLX availability when Antfly inference is
built with both backends enabled. A later 4-token compiled whole-model smoke was
failing before model execution with `MlxMetalUnavailable`; the long-term fix is
to keep `.metal` sessions on the native Metal provider/stream path and reserve
MLX streams/providers for the `.mlx` backend. The repaired smoke
`pkg/inference/.debug/metal-command-20260507-222950` passed API validation with
`token_ids: 10979 236888 2088 740`, `prefill=157ms`, `decode=149ms`,
`total=1006ms`, and no diagnostic reports.

### Phase 3: Performance Work

Baseline, no-MTP prefill/decode optimization is tracked separately in
[GEMMA4_PERF_PLAN.md](./GEMMA4_PERF_PLAN.md). That roadmap owns
the pinned llama.cpp comparison, current experiment ledger, promotion gates,
and ordered Metal kernel/runtime tranches. MTP speedups are additive and must
not be used to qualify the baseline model path.

- Tune `speculative_k`; start at 4 and compare against 2, 6, and 8.
- Add a heuristic schedule that increases draft length after full acceptance
  and decreases it after rejection.
- Benchmark dense Gemma 4 separately from the 26B MoE model. MoE verification
  can lose speedup at batch size 1 because drafted tokens may route to
  different experts.
- Prefer batched server benchmarks for MoE models, where expert reuse is more
  likely.
- Keep the compiled graph route as the single public Metal whole-model path.
  Avoid reintroducing a second live-executor CLI route; graph execution should
  own attachment, fallback, greedy-token shortcuts, and future prefill/decode
  scheduling.
- Fill the remaining GGML-shaped gaps behind generic quant entrypoints:
  extend the monolithic whole-block kernels beyond Q8_0, add any missing
  format-specific fused matvec kernels, and keep the layer/block planner
  independent of the physical quant format.

## Correctness Rules

- The target model always owns final token acceptance.
- Sampling, repetition penalties, and grammar masks must be applied from the
  target logits during verification.
- Rejected draft suffixes must be rolled back from KV state.
- Correction and bonus tokens must be present in target KV before they are
  consumed by later target work. The supported deferred-materialization path
  may fold that materialization into the next verify round; it flushes any
  pending token before another operation that requires committed target KV.
  Gemma 4 MTP assistants have no drafter KV; they keep only the
  target-prediction activation needed to seed the next draft round.
- MTP must fall back to standard decoding if the assistant is missing,
  incompatible, or slower for the current backend.

## Open Questions

- What is the exact public Transformers implementation for
  `Gemma4AssistantForCausalLM`? The tagged public Gemma 4 files do not yet show
  it, so implementation should follow confirmed artifacts plus LiteRT-LM
  behavior until upstream source is visible.
- Do assistant checkpoints expose enough metadata to validate exact target
  compatibility, or do we need a local compatibility table?
- Should the experimental inverse `masked_embedding.token_ordering` environment
  override be removed now that MLX-VLM confirms centroid-to-token ordering?
- Should the clustered embedder move into a cached backend-native path? The
  baseline implementation currently materializes the ordering on host per draft
  step for correctness/debuggability.
- Should speculative scheduling be per-request, per-model, or learned from
  recent acceptance-rate telemetry?
