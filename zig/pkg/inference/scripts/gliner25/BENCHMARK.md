# GLiNER2.5 CPU comparison

For the matched Antfly Metal versus Fastino MPS/CPU campaign, see
[METAL_BENCHMARK.md](METAL_BENCHMARK.md).

This harness compares the native **direct core** with pinned Fastino CPU FP32
inference. It does not exercise HTTP, model resolution, admission, batching,
serving cancellation, Metal, quantization, or training. A completed report is
not a production performance qualification.

The native worker and Python worker load the same immutable model bundle once.
The driver starts them serially, then executes one worker at a time in balanced
AB/BA pairs. Both model copies remain resident. Default CPU math budget is one
thread: native scheduling uses serial Io; BLAS environment controls and Torch
intra/inter-op settings are recorded. With system BLAS disabled, the native
worker admits only the one-thread profile.

Each measured call includes schema parsing and compilation, preprocessing,
encoder, all requested learned heads, decoding, and temporary cleanup. Model
loading, protocol parsing, wire serialization, and destruction of the returned
result are excluded. Both implementations rebuild their schema inside every
measured call; this harness does not compare a cached schema against a fresh
schema. Native execution also retains cooperative deadline checks.

Before timing a workload, the driver requires exact encoder token IDs, source
spans, text, labels, selected records, ordinary relations, and typed JointIE
endpoints against the checked-in variant reference. Only confidence tolerates
an absolute FP32 difference of `5e-4`. Each warmup and measured output is checked
again outside the clock. Any mismatch prevents a successful report. Startup and
shutdown rehash the actual model bytes; the driver also rechecks the executable
and source checkout. No model download is performed.

Build from `zig/`, through the repository graph:

```sh
zig build inference-bench-gliner25-cpu-build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dmetal=false -Dcuda=false -Donnx=false -Dpjrt=false -j1
```

Pass these flags explicitly: the modular repository build uses one shared
dependency graph, and the worker rejects other optimization/backend profiles.
The executable is installed at
`zig/zig-out/bin/antfly-inference-gliner25-cpu-bench` relative to the repository
root. A standalone build from `zig/pkg/inference/` uses the unprefixed target
`bench-gliner25-cpu-build` and its package-local `zig-out/bin/` instead.

Run an initial bounded smoke from the repository root with the pinned oracle
venv and already verified model directory:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 /private/tmp/antfly-gliner25-oracle-venv/bin/python zig/pkg/inference/scripts/gliner25/benchmark_cpu.py run --native-bin zig/zig-out/bin/antfly-inference-gliner25-cpu-bench --model small --model-root /private/tmp/antfly-gliner25-models --upstream /private/tmp/antfly-gliner25-upstream --cases mixed_tasks --threads 1 --warmup 1 --pairs 2 --max-rss-mib 8192 --output /private/tmp/gliner25-cpu-smoke
```

Use `--model base`, `--model multi`, or explicitly `--model all` for serial
variant comparisons. Omitting `--cases` selects all ten captured task requests.
The default is two warmups and six measured pairs per case. These short curated
requests cover task correctness, not a representative throughput corpus.

Workers have command/response size caps, per-call deadlines, explicit stop
handshakes, startup timeouts, and a shared RSS ceiling sampled every 100 ms.
This is an observed RSS guard, not a kernel memory reservation; transient peaks
between samples may be missed. On failure, only spawned workers are terminated,
`report.json` is marked failed, and diagnostic logs are retained. Successful
reports retain actual preflight outputs/tokens, immutable artifact identities,
thread/build profiles, raw paired timings, paired latency-ratio confidence
intervals, observed RSS, and a content manifest. Ratios below one mean native
latency was lower on that particular workload.

These benchmark scripts and outputs are intentionally outside the oracle
reference-generator closure.

## Recorded CPU run, 2026-09-09

All three immutable FP32 checkpoints completed all ten requests, with exact
encoder IDs and output decisions checked before timing and output parity
checked again for every warmup and measured call. The run used macOS arm64,
Zig 0.16.0, ReleaseFast throughout the native graph, system BLAS, one math
thread, three warmups and twenty balanced measurement pairs per request.
Both model copies remained resident; the combined RSS ceiling was 6144 MiB.

Values below are the paired native/Python latency ratio and a 95% bootstrap
interval over the twenty pairs. A ratio below one favors native execution.

Mixed-task median native/Python latency was 14.469/18.692 ms for small,
36.174/45.159 ms for base, and 41.093/51.173 ms for multilingual. Combined
sampled worker RSS peaked at 1389.7, 2297.8 and 2925.1 MiB respectively; these
are two-process observations, not individual inference memory requirements.

The local evidence directory is `/private/tmp/gliner25-cpu-all-tasks-v2`.
`report.json` SHA-256 is
`fd6aa011026bcd6cef008eb46205cc09ffe82c8a83a3c0c1051064951a250776`;
the measured native executable SHA-256 is

The report includes exact artifact/runtime pins, every preflight output, raw
pairs, worker commands and the evidence content manifest. Preserve that
directory with any qualification review; a rebuild is a different artifact.

This is one host/session and ten short curated requests per variant. The
report identifies arm64 but does not capture the exact CPU chip, affinity,
thermal state or power state. Small-model Python variability was 8.6–16.6%
coefficient of variation across these tasks, so bootstrap intervals describe
this sample rather than independent host-session reproducibility. The run
does not establish production p95, concurrency, corpus quality, long-document,
Metal, reduced-precision, training or serving performance. Its
`performance_release_qualified` and `serving_qualified` fields remain false.
