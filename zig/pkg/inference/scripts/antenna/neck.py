"""The Antenna GLiNER neck for the upstream PyTorch oracle.

An Antenna student may carry a neck: a learned linear map from the trunk's
final hidden states into the space the boundary heads read, applied to every
token before routing (``models.gliner_boundary.Neck`` in the native runtime).
Its config declares ``"antenna_neck": "linear"`` and its weights carry
``gliner_neck.weight`` ``[hidden, hidden]`` and ``gliner_neck.bias``.

Upstream GLiNER2 loads state dicts strictly and knows no neck, so ``load``
removes the neck tensors before upstream's load and ``attach`` installs them
as a ``gliner_neck`` module on the encoder's output. The module is a
registered submodule, so ``save_pretrained`` writes the tensors back and
upstream's trainer optimizes them in the task group (its name has no
"encoder").
