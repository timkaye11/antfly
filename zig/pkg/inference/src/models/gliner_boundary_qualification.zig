// native and Metal backends at fp32 (the published safetensors precision;
// no GGUF conversion is qualified). Evidence:
//
//  - Identity: digests match scripts/gliner25/oracle_manifest.json's "base"
//    entry byte-for-byte and were reproduced independently with
//    `shasum -a 256` against the pulled artifact
//    (~/.antfly/inference/models/fastino/gliner2.5-base-v1).
//  - Correctness: native and Metal full-pipeline parity against the pinned
//    Python/Fastino reference for all ten canonical task fixtures
//    (testdata/gliner25/pipeline_cases_base.json) -- entities, relations,
//    entity attributes, classification, natural/latent/anchorless records,
//    legacy structures, enum fields, constrained classification, and
//    JointIE -- via `zig build inference-test -Doptimize=fast --
//    --test-filter "gliner boundary"` with ANTFLY_GLINER25_BASE_MODEL_DIR
//    set to the pulled artifact: "gliner boundary pipeline Python parity
//    pinned base checkpoint all inference tasks" and "gliner boundary
//    device Metal pinned base full inference pipeline parity".
//  - Geometry: measured directly against the pinned tokenizer over the same
//    ten fixtures plus the shortest and longest reviewed requests, in
//    ../../extractors/gliner_boundary_qualification.zig ("gliner boundary
//    qualification measures pinned base checkpoint production geometry").
//    The bounds below are the exact observed range; widening them requires
//    new measurement, not extrapolation.
//  - Throughput: BENCHMARK.md's 2026-09-09 recorded CPU run for this exact
//    checkpoint (native/Python latency ratios 0.58-0.80 across the same ten
//    tasks; mixed-task median 36.174 ms native versus 45.159 ms Python).

//    mergeMentions; relations are resolved only when both endpoints fall in
//    one window and then merged/deduplicated document-wide by

//    exact merge path end to end -- one against a real 37KB multi-window
//    design-doc section (zig/VOPR.md's "Completion-Claim Audit"), one
//    deterministically against the known repro relation -- through both the

//    source.entity_index/target.entity_index, score) with no head/tail
//    fields, on both backends.
//  - Geometry: measured directly against the pinned tokenizer/planner (no
//    model weights) over the real examples/dogfood production schema (11
//    entities, 6 relations) against the same short fixtures as the
//    single-window row above, three real repository sections spanning the

//    real sections, per a docsaf-accurate Go-side sweep of the whole ingest
//    corpus) up to 130KB and 182KB/28275 words, well past every individual
//    real section docsaf currently produces, to qualify past the corpus's
//    single-section maximum with real margin -- each swept at
//    window_words=1024 (the wire's default; see extraction_v2.zig's
//    LongDocument doc comment and GLINER25.md's throughput section for why)

//    into), in ../../extractors/gliner_boundary_qualification.zig ("gliner
//    boundary qualification measures pinned base checkpoint long-document
//    production geometry"). The bounds below are the union of both sweeps'
//    exact observed ranges (window_count differs sharply by window size --
//    up to 29 windows at 1024 words each versus up to 8 at 4096 -- everything
//    else the two sweeps measured overlaps). This also qualifies the

//
//  - Identity: `antfly-inference-gliner25-convert` run twice into independent
//    output directories produced byte-identical `model.gguf` files
//    (independently reproduced with `shasum -a 256`, not just the tool's own

//    checkpoint and carry the identical digests as `fastino_gliner25_base_v1`
//    above (`gliner_boundary_bundle.validate` enforces this on every load).
//    The bundle's own receipt independently records its exact fp32
//    `model.safetensors` source digest.
//  - Correctness: `pipelines/gliner_boundary_pipeline.zig`'s "... converted
//    fp16 encoder base checkpoint all inference tasks native/metal" open the
//    converted bundle through the SAME `session_factory.createNativeSession`/
//    `createMetalSession` + `getManagedComputeBackend` + `encodeNative`/
//    `runNative` (native) or `gliner_boundary_request_device.run` (Metal)
//    path production requests use (not a raw-safetensors harness, and not
//    `gliner25-bundle-check`'s informal diagnostic), and assert all ten
//    canonical fixtures with the same `expectSample` comparator the fp32
//    pinned tests use.
//  - Reviewed tolerance decision: an independent `gliner25-bundle-check`
//    sweep of every one of the 62 comparable confidence values across all
//    ten canonical fixtures, both backends (not just the values `expectSample`
//    happens to assert), found 61/62 within the fp32 rows' 5e-4 bound; the
//    62nd (`entity_attributes`, idx 1) is 5.909e-4 (Metal) / 5.911e-4
//    (native) -- deterministically the SAME fixture, value, and magnitude to
//    six decimal places on both backends despite independent native/Metal
//    matmul kernels, which is the signature of fp16 weight-rounding noise
//    propagated through the encoder, not a backend-specific compute defect
//    (confirmed by code audit: both backends' F16 matmul upcasts each weight
//    element to f32 before multiply-accumulate --
//    zig/lib/linalg/src/mod.zig's `sgemmTransBF16Weights*` and
//    `metal_kernels.m`'s `termite_apply_linear_f16_multi_row_reduce` --  and
//    every boundary activation/attention/softmax/layernorm op runs through a
//    strictly-FP32 pipeline on both backends regardless of weight precision).
//    Next-largest deltas are 3.1e-4, 2.3e-4, 2.2e-4, comfortably inside
//    tolerance; mean 5.7e-5, median 2.2e-5 across all 62 values. Every one of
//    the 62 values' associated decision -- entity/relation set, label, and
//    span -- is byte-identical to the fp32 reference on every fixture, both
//    backends: only the confidence float itself ever differs. This is the
//    reviewed basis for `pipelines/gliner_boundary_pipeline.zig`'s
//    `fp16_encoder_confidence_tolerance = 7.5e-4` (measured max plus
//    headroom), which is the qualified bound for this row's evidence, not a
//    tolerance bump made for its own sake.

// Long-document windowed execution for fastino_gliner25_base_v1_fp16_encoder,
// reviewed 2026-09-19. examples/dogfood requests windowing unconditionally
// (index_config.go's knowledgeGraphIndexJSON), and essentially every real
// section its corpus produces needs it (section 3/9's LengthContract),
// so a single-window-only fp16 row cannot serve real dogfood traffic.
// Evidence, following exactly the pattern the fp32 long-document row above
// used:
//
//  - Geometry: re-running the long-document geometry-measuring test in
//    ../../extractors/gliner_boundary_qualification.zig with
//    ANTFLY_GLINER25_BASE_MODEL_DIR pointed at the converted fp16 bundle
//    directory reproduces fastino_gliner25_base_v1_long_document_lengths
//    byte-for-byte at both the 1024- and 4096-word sweeps (the test reads
//    only the tokenizer/JSON config and runs the planner, never model
//    weights, so this is a valid substitution). The row below reuses that
//    fp32 LengthContract and feature set unchanged.
//  - Correctness/shape: the same long-executor canonical-shape tests the
//    fp32 row's evidence used, parametrized over ANTFLY_GLINER25_BASE_FP16_MODEL_DIR
//    instead of ANTFLY_GLINER25_BASE_MODEL_DIR (server/gliner_boundary_service_test.zig's
//    resolveModelDirectoryFromEnv) rather than copy-pasted: the 37KB VOPR.md
//    "Completion-Claim Audit" multi-window document through both the HTTP
//    handler and the in-process provider entry (native and Metal), the
//    ~99KB PDF.md corpus-maximum section through both entries (native, the
//    same backend the fp32 row's corpus-maximum evidence used), and the
//    corpus-minimum documents (20-byte SCHEMA.md section, 1-byte document)
//    through the provider entry on both backends -- all pass with the
//    canonical schema_version 2 envelope, zero head/tail keys, and (for the
//    multi-window/corpus-maximum documents) window_count confirming the
//    merge path actually ran.
//  - fp32-vs-fp16 parity through the long executor (not required of the
//    fp32 row itself, but specific evidence for qualifying a second
//    precision against it): "gliner boundary long executor fp32 vs fp16
//    encoder parity on real long documents" in
//    server/gliner_boundary_service_test.zig runs the SAME VOPR.md,
//    PDF.md-max, and corpus-minimum documents through both bundles on both
//    backends and matches every entity/relation decision (label, text,
//    span) between precisions order-independently by identity (a near-tied
//    pair can legitimately trade places in the final array without being a
//    decision difference), then requires every matched confidence delta to
//    fall within the reviewed fp16_encoder_long_document_confidence_tolerance
//    = 2.5e-3 (pipelines/gliner_boundary_pipeline.zig) -- deliberately wider
//    than the single-window fp16_encoder_confidence_tolerance, because the
//    long executor's cross-window duplicate-mention tie-break can surface a
//    genuinely larger, but still bounded and deterministic, disagreement
//    between two different windows' independent estimates for the same
//    span. See that constant's doc comment and GLINER25.md's fp16-encoder
//    long-document qualification section for the measured delta
//    distribution and root cause.
