# libantfly Conformance Cases

Shared, declarative test cases for the `libantfly` C ABI and every language
binding built on it. Each binding runs the same cases through its own public
API, so the bindings stay behaviorally identical without each one reinventing
its smoke tests.

Runners:

| Runner | Location | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Reference (raw C ABI via `antfly.h`) | `zig/pkg/antfly-embedded/src/capi/conformance_runner.zig` | `zig build capi-conformance` |
| Go | `go/pkg/embedded/conformance_cgo_test.go` | `go test -tags libantfly -run Conformance` |
| Python | `py/packages/embedded/tests/test_conformance.py` | `uv run pytest tests/test_conformance.py` |
| Rust | `rs/crates/embedded/tests/conformance.rs` | `cargo test -p antfly-embedded --features libantfly --test conformance` |

`zig build lite-test` runs all of them. A new C ABI behavior that bindings
should agree on belongs here as a case, not only in one binding's tests.

## Case Format

Each `cases/*.json` file is one case:

```json
{
  "name": "document_roundtrip",
  "description": "What the case proves.",
  "open": {"create": true, "mode": "writer", "profile": "native", "no_sync": true},
  "steps": [
    {"op": "batch", "timestamp": 1, "writes": [{"key": "doc:a", "value": {"title": "a"}}]},
    {"op": "lookup", "key": "doc:a", "expect": {"json_subset": {"title": "a"}}},
    {"op": "lookup", "key": "doc:missing", "expect": {"error": "ANTFLY_NOT_FOUND"}}
  ]
}
```

A runner creates a fresh temporary directory per case. The database lives at
`<tmp>/db.aflite`. `open` is applied before the first step and uses the same
fields as `reopen` below; `create: true` creates a new database, otherwise an
existing one is opened. Every field of `open` is optional:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `storage` | `"lite"` | `"lite"` (a `.aflite` file) or `"directory"` (a normal Antfly directory) |
| `create` | `false` | Create a new database instead of opening one. Lite only: directory storage is created by opening a missing path |
| `mode` | `"writer"` | `"writer"`, `"readonly"`, or `"status_only"` |
| `profile` | `"native"` | `"native"` or `"hosted"` |
| `no_sync` | `false` | Skip fsync (tests use `true`) |
| `busy_timeout_ms` | `0` | Wait this long for another writer's lock |
| `path` | `"db.aflite"` | File or directory name inside the case directory |

Runners open with the binding's options-taking open/create call, which maps
to `antfly_db_open_with_options` / `antfly_db_create_with_options` with an
`antfly_open_options` built from these fields.

## Expectations

A step without `expect` must succeed. Otherwise `expect` may combine:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` | The call fails with this `antfly_error_code_name`, e.g. `"ANTFLY_BUSY"`. No other key is checked. |
| `json_subset` | The result parses as JSON and contains this value recursively: objects match when every expected key matches, arrays match element-wise with equal length, scalars match exactly. |
| `contains` | Every string is a substring of the raw result text. |
| `not_contains` | No string is a substring of the raw result text. |
| `equals` | The scalar result equals this value (booleans, integers, strings). |

## Operations

Values written as JSON objects in a case (`value`, `request`, `config`,
`schema`) are serialized with the runner's JSON encoder before the call.
"Result" is the JSON text the call returns.

| `op` | Fields | Call | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `batch` | `writes: [{key, value?, delete?}]`, `timestamp` | `antfly_db_batch` (typed write intents, no predicates, `sync_level` 0; `delete: true` omits `value`) | none |
| `batch_json` | `request` | `antfly_db_batch_json` | JSON |
| `lookup` | `key` | `antfly_db_lookup_json` | JSON document |
| `scan` | `request` | `antfly_db_scan_json` | JSON |
| `search` | `request` | `antfly_db_search_json` | JSON |
| `stats` | | `antfly_db_stats_json` | JSON |
| `status` | | `antfly_db_status_json` | JSON |
| `capabilities` | | `antfly_db_capabilities_json` | JSON |
| `check` | | `antfly_lite_check_json` | JSON |
| `pending_work_stats` | | `antfly_db_pending_work_stats_json` | JSON |
| `run_until_idle` | | `antfly_db_run_until_idle` | none |
| `get_schema` | | `antfly_db_get_schema_json` | JSON |
| `set_schema` | `schema` | `antfly_db_set_schema_json` | none |
| `list_indexes` | | `antfly_db_list_indexes_json` | JSON |
| `add_index` | `config` | `antfly_db_add_index_json` | none |
| `delete_index` | `name` | `antfly_db_delete_index` | boolean: whether it existed |
| `get_edges` | `index`, `key`, `edge_type` (`""` for all), `direction` (`"out"`/`"in"`/`"both"`, default `"out"`) | `antfly_db_get_edges_json` with `ANTFLY_GRAPH_DIRECTION_*` | JSON |
| `list_enrichments` | | `antfly_db_list_enrichments_json` | JSON |
| `add_enrichment` | `config` | `antfly_db_add_enrichment_json` | none |
| `delete_enrichment` | `kind`, `name` | `antfly_db_delete_enrichment` | boolean: whether it existed |
| `begin_transaction` | `txn_id` (32 hex chars), `timestamp` | `antfly_db_begin_transaction_with_id` (no participants) | none |
| `write_transaction` | `txn_id`, `writes` | `antfly_db_write_transaction` (no predicates) | none |
| `resolve_transaction` | `txn_id`, `status` (`"committed"`/`"aborted"`), `commit_version` | `antfly_db_resolve_intents` | none |
| `transaction_status` | `txn_id` | `antfly_db_get_transaction_status` | string: `"pending"`, `"committed"`, or `"aborted"` |
| `commit_version` | `txn_id` | `antfly_db_get_commit_version` | integer |
| `backup` | | `antfly_db_backup` | none; the runner keeps the bytes |
| `import_backup` | | `antfly_db_import_backup` of the kept bytes into the current handle | none |
| `restore_open` | `path`, open fields | `antfly_restore_backup_json` of the kept bytes to `path` with options built from the open fields (so `storage` picks the destination kind; no replace), then closes the current handle and opens `path` as the current handle | none |
| `reopen` | open fields | closes the current handle, then opens with these fields (default path: the current handle's path) | none |
| `open_second` | open fields | opens another handle while the current one stays open, then closes it if the open succeeded | none |
| `close` | | closes the current handle; only `reopen` or `restore_open` may follow | none |

`batch` timestamps are nanoseconds and must increase within a case.

### SQL driver conformance

`sql/cases.json` is shared by Go's database/sql tests, Python's PEP 249 tests,
Rust's SQLx tests, and TypeScript's connection tests. Expected integer cells
are decimal strings. Cases cover positional binding, exact int64, booleans,
text, JSON, NULL, and SQLSTATE. Driver tests additionally exercise transaction
isolation, savepoints, foreign keys, catalog reopen, and streaming past 128
rows. Run Rust with `--features libantfly,sqlx --test sqlx`; the other packages
discover SQL tests with their ordinary native-library test commands.

The database SQL driver cases are in `sql/cases.json`. Before running them,
seed `sql/search-fixture.json`: create `history_items` with its `history`
document schema and the named vector table with its index definitions, apply
the batch, and drain native work. Go database/sql, Rust
SQLx, Python DB-API and TypeScript Connection run these same DDL, full-text,
dense, sparse and hybrid join cases, including search sources in UPDATE and
DELETE, constraint validation retries, failed UNIQUE repair, redundant UNIQUE
retirement, FK constraint publication, and child-table retirement/recreation.
