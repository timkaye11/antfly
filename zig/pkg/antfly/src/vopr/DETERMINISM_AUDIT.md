# Metadata VOPR Determinism Audit

This is the preserved Phase 0 baseline inventory for the first metadata world:
`metadata/vopr_harness.zig`, including its `raft/sim_harness.zig` transport.
The table records the risks as originally audited; the resolution summary below
states the current adapter status.

| Input class | Current use | Phase 0 classification | Adapter requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Campaign randomness | `runMetadataVoprCampaign` creates `DefaultPrng` from `cfg.seed`; transport action selection and parameters consume that stream. | Seeded, but opaque. A seed reproduces only while draw order and enabled actions remain identical. | Move every draw behind `ChoiceSource`; record the site, occurrence, canonical enabled IDs, and selected ID. |
| Network delivery | `VirtualHttpNetwork` owns a virtual tick, FIFO/seeded-random release, partitions, drops, duplication, and tick delays. Managed HTTP simulation forces synchronous transport and `sim://` endpoints. | Controlled. The internal random streams are independently seeded but are not yet recorded choices. | Expose message delivery and loss decisions as transitions; retain virtual ticks as world state. |
| Metadata time | `MetadataHttpClusterVopr` owns a `ManualClock`, starts at 1,000 ms, and advances 100 ms in `stepAll`/`stepAllExcept`. Retry clocks use virtual network ticks. | Controlled in the first world. | Make clock advance an explicit transition and include logical time in observations. |
| Real time fallback | `currentGroupStatusTimestampMs` calls `Clock.real().nowRealtimeMs()`. | Uncontrolled whenever this helper participates in scenario-visible state. | Inject the scenario clock and remove the fallback from replayable paths before the metadata Phase 1 exit condition. |
| Sleep | `DelayingRequestExecutor` and several Raft harness tests call POSIX `nanosleep`. | Uncontrolled and unsuitable for a replayable scenario. The first metadata VOPR uses virtual delay faults, but shares a module containing this path. | Reject real-delay executors in replayable worlds; model delay as queued events and virtual-clock advances. |
| Threads | There are no direct `std.Thread`/spawn calls in either audited harness. `ManagedHttpClusterSimulation.init` forces `async_transport = false`; virtual base URIs make host `start`/`stop` no-ops, and metadata background runtimes use manual mode. | Controlled in the first world. Broader non-virtual harness modes can transitively start listeners or async runtimes and are outside this claim. | Add construction-time capability checks so replayable scenarios require manual background runtimes, virtual endpoints, and synchronous transport; admit task wakeups only as scheduler transitions. |
| Filesystem | Campaigns allocate `std.testing.tmpDir`, construct LMDB/catalog paths, and execute real storage code beneath those roots. Directory names are nondeterministic but are not intended semantic inputs. Host filesystem behavior and persisted bytes are real. | Partially controlled. Unique clean roots prevent cross-run contamination, but paths, host I/O errors, and physical timing must not enter choices or observations. | Normalize paths out of artifacts, hash fixture contents, use modeled storage for injected failures, and retain physical-storage replay as a differential mode. |
| External network | The first metadata world replaces HTTP routes with `VirtualHttpNetwork`; blackhole endpoints use loopback only in other focused tests. | Controlled for the first world. | Fail scenario construction if any executor is not registered with the virtual network. |
| Iteration/order | Enabled VOPR actions are currently selected by integer ranges and local control flow; several maps/catalogs may have implementation-defined iteration order. | Not yet proven canonical. | Scenario adapters must emit explicit transition descriptors and call `List.canonicalize`; observations must use `Builder.canonicalize`. |
| Process/environment | Temp roots, target, optimize mode, and source revision can differ. | Diagnostic only unless they alter behavior. | Record them in the header, but determine replay compatibility from simulator ABI plus scenario version. |

Phase 0 established the contracts that enforce the right edge of this table.
The metadata adapter now records structured choices and canonical enabled sets,
selects individual virtual messages/node rounds/time advances, requires virtual
synchronous transport for the replayable world, and stamps simulated group
status from the cluster's injected manual clock rather than host realtime.
Debug and ReleaseSafe each pass the dedicated 100-consecutive exact-replay
gate. Wall-clock delay executors, real listeners, and physical filesystem
behavior remain confined to explicitly identified integration tests; they are
not silently admitted into the in-process metadata replay kernel.

The preserved table is now backed by the executable
`vopr-determinism-audit` gate. It checks every exported Antfly VOPR source and
the `DistributedDataVoprScenario` and `MetadataVoprScenario` regions in the
mixed legacy metadata harness. Direct host entropy, delayed private PRNGs,
platform clocks, native threads or I/O, native libraries, unordered iteration,
and pointer-derived identity fail the gate. The remaining physical-storage
differential boundaries are line-local allowances with mandatory rationale;
they are not permitted to contribute choices, observations, events, or stable
IDs. Runtime evidence independently catalogs immediate structured choices and
borrowed-`std.Io` entropy calls.
