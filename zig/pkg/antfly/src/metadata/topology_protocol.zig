/// Wire capability required to decode atomic table-topology transitions.
/// Version 2 replaces the unbounded explicit range-id list in table drops
/// with a fixed-size membership contract. Version 3 fences create against the
/// replicated transition generation so recreated tables receive fresh data
/// group identities and stale drop cleanup cannot delete their storage.
/// Version 4 decodes and enforces the distinct extension-lifecycle-v2 command
/// carrying table compare-and-set preconditions.
/// Version 5 adds conditional restore admission; ordinary job updates retain
/// their existing wire format.
/// Version 6 adds digest-conditional restore expiry.
/// Versions 7–10 add system catalog publication, sparse store reports,
/// membership-bound protocol activation, and resumable store inventories.
/// Version 11 additionally requires relational topology, coordinated
/// backup/restore/retirement, Scope-v2 sources, staged rewrite final cuts, and
/// table storage metadata. Main's v10 decoders do not understand these commands.
/// Version 12 decodes the durable SQL setting catalog transition. Version 13
/// decodes inert native row-policy definitions; RLS activation is separate.
/// Version 14 decodes the durable row-policy publication/owner-ACK transition.
/// Version 15 decodes the durable fenced FK generation publication transition.
/// Version 16 decodes initial FK creation. Version 17 decodes the physical
/// store-root UUID extension in store registration records. Version 18 adds
/// the exact physical-root Ed25519 verifier. Version 19 adds administrator
/// enrollment, root-authenticated retirement ACKs, immutable artifact
/// inventory bindings for online merge admission, and typed FK table locks
/// distinguishing ordinary generation cuts from initial support reservation.
/// Version 20 admits ordered direct-vector artifact merges. The entire ordered
/// artifact workflow requires this capability, so a partial rolling upgrade
/// cannot certify a source whose later pages an older voter cannot execute.
/// Version 21 applies catalog-qualified DROP and physical topology removal in
/// one command. Earlier voters understand the union but reject its DROP arm.
/// Version 22 pins and persists native external-lake index generations in table
/// records and query definitions; earlier decoders reject the extension.
/// Version 23 moves lake artifact declarations into verified durable directories.
/// Version 24 adds independent native lake reader/retirement authority.
/// Version 25 admits paged aggregate contribution directories and reduction trees.
/// Version 26 admits keyed contribution trees and partitioned aggregate roots.
/// Version 27 persists reduction ownership for exact contribution retention.
/// Version 28 maintains immutable ownership counts and publication root sets.
/// Version 29 admits seekable native text corpora and their durable GC frontier.
/// Version 31 decodes bounded relation source-adoption and reconciliation-job
/// controls and independently prepared page advances. Serving/root activation and pending reservation sources remain
/// separate capabilities, never implied by this decoder floor.
/// Version 32 decodes independently verified live relation-root publication
/// and adopts every native namespace writer in the same durable transaction.
/// Version 33 decodes name-sensitive table replacements carrying an exact
/// relation-owner, logical-binding and metadata-incarnation mutation fence.
