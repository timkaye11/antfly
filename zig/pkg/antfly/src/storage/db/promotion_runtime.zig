//! Promoter stage (see zig/RESOLUTION.md).
//!
//! The promoter turns resolution decisions into durable entity state: for each
//! resolution artifact the resolution stage writes, it upserts the canonical
//! entity document into the entity table. Entities are sharded by entity key and
//! generally live on a *different* shard than the source document, so the actual
//! write goes through an injected `EntitySink` (the write-side analog of the
//! resolver's `CandidateSource`) which the api/serving layer implements over the
//! routing-aware table write path. In raft deployments promotion is additionally
//! guarded by an injected `PromotionOwner` so only the source shard's current
//! leader turns replay into public entity writes. With no sink the stage waits by
//! default; callers can explicitly disable promotion when that is intended.
//!
//! Replay stability: a durable companion row records each promoted decision.
//! Replaying an unchanged decision skips the sink, which merges canonical
//! fields and unions aliases. The stage advances `applied_sequence` only after
//! the upserts return.
