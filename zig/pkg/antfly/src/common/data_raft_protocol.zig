/// Version 1 adds the internal `_timestamp_ns` field to data-Raft batch log
/// entries. Version 2 adds the fail-closed, durable activation barrier used to
/// turn newer formats on without retaining capability probes in the write
/// path. Version 3 adds replicated merge source fences and receiver
/// checkpoints; those controls must never appear before a durable v3 barrier.
/// Version 4 adds predecessor-fenced split deltas so sparse source Raft-index
/// watermarks cannot be mistaken for omitted replication work.
/// Version 5 transfers authoritative merge artifacts through durable replay.
/// Version 6 fences merge copy attempts across donor leadership changes.
