/// Version 1 adds the internal `_timestamp_ns` field to data-Raft batch log
/// entries. Version 2 adds the fail-closed, durable activation barrier used to
/// turn newer formats on without retaining capability probes in the write
/// path. Version 3 adds replicated merge source fences and receiver
/// checkpoints; those controls must never appear before a durable v3 barrier.
/// Version 4 adds predecessor-fenced split deltas so sparse source Raft-index
/// watermarks cannot be mistaken for omitted replication work.
/// Version 5 transfers authoritative merge artifacts through durable replay.
/// Version 6 fences merge copy attempts across donor leadership changes.
/// Version 7 commits source-bound merge page effects and cursor atomically.
/// Version 8 adds source retention admission and receiver tail-watermark fences.
/// Version 9 requires durable source pins before acknowledgement and supports
/// resumable row chunks whose completion atomically advances receiver progress.
/// Version 10 requires native-authoritative Raft snapshots for source groups,
/// preserving the retained journal and prepared transaction state on replicas.
/// Version 11 retains coordinated integrity effects with primary rows, fences
/// shadow-interval publication, and supports retained-source staged rewrites.
/// Version 12 binds retained source Scope v2 to an explicit Raft/native
/// authority. Older decoders must not reinterpret its clock or pin identity.
/// Version 13 batches coordinator acknowledgements. All applying replicas
/// must cross the durable activation barrier before this command is admitted.
