# Graph metric execution and query benchmarks

## Streaming page-tree bootstrap (2026-09-11)

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --page-bootstrap-only
```

Apple M4 Max, Zig 0.16.0, five measured samples after one warmup, generated
sorted 8-byte keys and 64-byte values. Memory below includes the builder's
owned records, routing entries and serialized page buffers, but excludes the
in-memory storage transport. There is no pre-materialized input array.

| Records | Peak builder bytes | PUTs | GETs | Output bytes | Median |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1,024 | 120,200 | 4 | 0 | 82,375 | 0.089 ms |
| 131,072 | 158,768 | 323 | 0 | 10,528,642 | 8.356 ms |
| 1,048,576 | 182,984 | 2,579 | 0 | 84,229,010 | 67.661 ms |

The builder retains one pending page per height rather than graph-wide arrays
of leaf and routing entries. Each successful build writes only final reachable
pages. Tests cover borrowed source buffers, page boundaries, failed allocations,
invalid ordering and interrupted writes. These results exclude document parsing,
external sorting, metric preparation and manifest publication. The measurements
include the attempt-scoped v3 page reference format. They are not an end-to-end
build speedup; the complete publication benchmark below covers that path.

## Committed status and immutable memory-run pins (2026-09-10)

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --ownership-reads-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --ownership-disk-reads-only
```

Apple M4 Max, Zig 0.16.0, median of five samples after one warmup. These
measure empty incoming adjacency reads behind an ownership fence, including
snapshot/cursor setup and cleanup. First/last target probes verify the same
empty result. Fixture ingestion and fence installation are excluded.

| Edges | Memory LSM before (first / last) | Memory LSM pinned (first / last) | Durable LSM warm (first / last) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4,096 | 300.458 / 264.750 µs | 1.458 / 2.166 µs | 2.125 / 2.167 µs |
| 16,384 | 1,023.500 / 1,010.333 µs | 1.042 / 1.209 µs | 1.750 / 1.750 µs |
| 65,536 | 4,337.333 / 4,053.083 µs | 1.125 / 1.042 µs | 1.875 / 1.583 µs |

The memory-backed improvement removes whole-run cloning from snapshot setup.
The durable column is a separate absolute measurement, **not** a before/after
disk speedup. These are local warm microbenchmarks, not network latency or
ingestion throughput. Ten thousand operational-status samples take 22–29 µs
per batch, with zero extra allocations. Status publication now happens only
after the counter transaction commits; failure-injection tests verify that
aborted/staged counts cannot escape through operational status.

## Ownership fences and lazy type runs (2026-09-10)

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --filtered-prefix-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --prune-only
```

Apple M4 Max, Zig 0.16.0, five measured samples after one warmup. The filtered
benchmark uses a 100,000-edge hub with 64 edge types, a fresh reader per query,
in-memory artifact transport and no shared cache. Every variant returns the same
first edge; timings include authentication, string ownership and cleanup.

| Requested types | Median | GETs | Fetched bytes | Inspected edges |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Wildcard | 0.214 ms | 7 | 299,988 | 1 |
| First type only | 0.320 ms | 10 | 496,596 | 18 |
| All 64 explicitly | 0.216 ms | 7 | 299,988 | 1 |

The pre-change diagnostic on the same fixture used 36 GETs, 2,200,532 fetched
bytes and 2,148 edge inspections for all 64 types. Canonical adjacent type runs
now share endpoint seeks, and unconsumed runs perform no edge I/O. Selecting
the whole dictionary requires no endpoint probes. This removes 81% of GETs
and 86% of fetched bytes for that query without changing its result or budget.
These are physical-work reductions, not a network-latency prediction. A narrow
interior filter still requires logarithmic endpoint searches.

Stateful split acknowledgment no longer drains physical topology. The durable
ownership task fences metrics and, once activated by the primary range commit,
filters outgoing and reverse reads by source ownership. Retirement runs in
1,024-record / 4 MiB identity pages through the existing maintenance scheduler.
Each completed page atomically advances its durable key cursor with reverse
accounting, avoiding scans through earlier pages' tombstones after a yield or
restart. A separate raw-LSM diagnostic with 65,535 tombstones measured an
original-lower-bound seek at 2.56 ms versus 0.37 µs for the surviving key;
this isolates seek CPU and excludes persistence and page mutation.

| Retired edges | Fence median | Complete retirement | Largest page | Scoped empty incoming lookup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4,096 | 1.558 ms | 101.870 ms | 31.227 ms | 0.551 ms |
| 16,384 | 16.506 ms | 476.265 ms | 50.049 ms | 0.923 ms |
| 65,536 | 1.757 ms | 3,316.889 ms | 159.168 ms | 1.330 ms |

The default durable LSM benchmark excludes insertion and includes all retirement
durability barriers. Fence timing covers private graph metadata and its sync,
not end-to-end Raft apply or primary coverage rebasing. It does not configure
metrics; fencing cost also depends on the configured metric count. Storage
maintenance and fsync can dominate even a small transaction (as the 16K sample
illustrates); page bounds are work/memory bounds, not hard wall-clock deadlines.
The architectural improvement is removing the complete edge drain from split
acknowledgment and allowing apply ownership to be released between pages.

## Retained native cursors and durable lifecycle ownership (2026-09-10)

In-process adjacency streams retain their native read snapshots and physical
cursor across bounded batches. Logical resume cursors remain the RPC paging
contract. Both paths share allocation-free encoded-key inspection and admit the
complete decoded edge size before allocating identifiers or metadata. Native
scans close their resources on exhaustion, errors, or explicit early stopping;
they do not advance into the unrequested tail just to manufacture a resume key.

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --native-scans-only
```

Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0; warm default durable LSM, 65,536 outgoing hub edges
inserted in sixteen 4,096-edge batches. Five samples after one warmup per mode,
with each comparison repeated. Both paths decode identical results in batches
of 64 using the current admission implementation; setup is excluded, scan and
result cleanup included.

| Workload | Logical pages | Retained cursor |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Full scan median, repeated runs | 23.19–24.28 ms | 18.70–18.81 ms |
| Full scan query allocation count | 209,918 | 203,778 |
| Full scan peak query-owned bytes | 10,848 | 10,786 |
| First-edge median, repeated runs | 4.38–4.75 µs | 4.38–4.42 µs |

Retaining the cursor reduced full-scan time by approximately 19–23% without
increasing the batch size. First-edge timings are too small/noisy to establish
a latency improvement. Query allocation statistics exclude storage-owned
snapshots/cursors; this is a local scan benchmark, not an end-to-end cloud or
ingestion throughput claim.

Repair now treats metric score epochs, cleanup cursors, and operator intent as
durable lifecycle state rather than rebuildable counters. Starting a repair
atomically fences numerical leases and advances the topology epoch, retaining
interrupted jobs for normal bounded retirement before lease takeover replaces
them. A full retirement queue therefore cannot prevent repair/reopen. Bounded
reconstruction preserves the lifecycle namespaces and topology task incarnation
sequence. Regression coverage includes unpublished score isolation,
restart between counter-rebuild pages, snapshot stability across intervening
LSM writes, escaped identities, all directions, duplicate types, oversized
payload admission, and allocation-failure cleanup.

## Demand-driven queries and recoverable pruning (2026-09-10)

The `--paged-only` harness now also runs complete dedicated limit-1 neighbor
and traversal queries with a one-edge scan budget. Apple M4 Max, Zig 0.16.0,
ReleaseSafe, five samples after one warmup; each query has a fresh session and
no shared cache. Timings include authentication, result ownership, and cleanup.

| 100,000-edge hub | Median | Fetched bytes | GETs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Eager row materialization | 11.566 ms | 4,070,765 | 64 |
| Limit-1 neighbors | 0.212 ms | 335,213 | 7 |
| Limit-1 traversal | 0.198 ms | 335,213 | 7 |

This compares a materialization baseline with complete prefix queries, not
identical result workloads or measured network latency. Both queries inspect
one edge; the old complete-row consumption could fail that budget before
returning an otherwise available first result.

`--prune-only` exercises the default durable stateful LSM with six insert/prune
cycles, excluding insertion from timing and discarding the first sample.
Pruning 4,096 edges measured 145.619 ms; 16,384 edges measured 676.200 ms. These
are absolute durability-inclusive costs, not a claimed speedup over the old
unsafe pruning path. Every page includes intent persistence, forward sync,
reverse accounting, and intent retirement, with a 1,024-record / 4 MiB identity
input bound. Tests separately interrupt pruning after the forward commit and
counter reconstruction between pages, then verify recovery on reopen.

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --paged-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --prune-only
```

## Streaming cursors, paged control, and tree batches (2026-09-10)

Current graph wire v9 / manifest v24 / materializer epoch 25 uses a 112-byte
trailer, a bounded authenticated root, and 64 KiB directory leaves. A directory
larger than 1 MiB stays addressable. Queries load type names and node fences
lazily, and request sessions share authenticated blocks with single-flight fills.

Reproduce the updated `--paged-only` benchmark and tree validation comparison:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --paged-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --tree-only
```

Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0, ReleaseFast; five timed samples after one warmup.
Hub comparisons use the same reader, immutable in-memory transport, and fresh
request-local caches. They differ only in consuming the entire hub versus
stopping at its first edge. Transport overfetch is included in byte counts.

| Workload | Eager/reference | Incremental/grouped |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 16,384-edge hub: local median | 1.335 ms | 0.124 ms |
| 16,384-edge hub: fetched bytes | 743,205 | 218,917 |
| 100,000-edge hub: local median | 7.600 ms | 0.216 ms |
| 100,000-edge hub: fetched bytes | 4,070,765 | 400,749 |
| 100,000-edge hub: origin GETs | 64 | 8 |
| 100,000-edge hub: inspected edges | 100,000 | 1 |
| 2,048 distinct tree writes: validation | 3.815 ms | 0.470 ms |
| 8,192 distinct tree writes: validation | 55.355 ms | 2.318 ms |
| 16,384 distinct tree writes: validation | 217.887 ms | 5.037 ms |

Tree measurements exercise read-only production validation against an empty
native graph, excluding fixture setup and commits. These are not end-to-end
ingestion speedups. The previous quadratic prior-write walk is retained only as
a benchmark oracle. Grouped validation also sorts source/type probes for storage
locality (included in these timings). Final-identity semantics, duplicate deletes/reinsertions,
and rejection before writes have separate regression coverage.

The 20,000-type fixture now remains paged (2,441,556 encoded bytes); preparation
uses seven GETs / 1,654,404 fetched bytes. Query tests verify that a fresh second
request sharing the authenticated cache performs zero origin reads. These are
CPU/I/O-work measurements, not claims about real cloud latency or throughput.

A four-million-node isolated-node fixture produces a 129,250,850-byte artifact
with a 1,250,060-byte directory. A cold point lookup succeeds with 792,076 fetched
bytes / 15 GETs and 726,428 retained control/data-cache bytes (0.576 ms locally).
This fixture uses production `finishEncoding` to build/authenticate its routing
structures; fixture construction is excluded from query timings. It validates
that node cardinality cannot trigger the former 1 MiB full-decode fallback.

## Addressed adjacency and existence-only mutation probes (2026-09-10)

The preceding baseline used graph wire v7, manifest wire v22, materializer epoch
23. Node-ordinal row offsets cost eight bytes per
dictionary node; dictionary fences add 68 bytes per 256-node page. Both are
authenticated by the manifest-bound control structure. The control directory
remains capped at 1 MiB; oversized controls explicitly omit the accelerator.

Reproduce with:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --paged-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --presence-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --indexing-only
```

Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0; medians of five measurements after one discarded
warmup. These are local microbenchmarks, not cloud end-to-end latency claims.

| Cold one-edge lookup | Whole graph | Addressed row |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 16,384 nodes: fetched bytes | 1,627,870 | 333,504 |
| 16,384 nodes: local median | 1.341 ms | 0.160 ms |
| 100,000 nodes: fetched bytes | 9,934,770 | 296,884 |
| 100,000 nodes: local median | 10.893 ms | 0.177 ms |
| GETs per fixture | 1 | 6 |

Every sample creates a fresh reader. The transport serves immutable memory and
counts exact GET bytes. Both paths assert the same neighbor. The full-decode
reference omits transport SHA verification, while the addressed path verifies
the footer, directory, and touched blocks. Network RTT can dominate six small
GETs; measure actual object-store latency before interpreting these CPU timings
as deployment speedups. Authenticated first-key fence prefixes avoid an object
GET for every dictionary binary-search comparison; common prefixes longer than
64 bytes fall back to a bounded search of the ambiguous pages.

The many-type preparation fixture has two nodes and one relationship per type.
64/1,024/10,000 types require 3/3/6 range reads and 7,580/117,020/812,860 bytes.
Before boundary-block reuse, the 10,000-type probe exhausted its 512 MiB read
allowance after 8,184 calls for a roughly 1.14 MiB source. The regression now
requires completion within 2 MiB, at most eight calls, and no source-size read
amplification. Block retention is one 64 KiB block, or less for small sources.
Point and traversal readers instead retain up to eight blocks (512 KiB) per
source under the request's admitted allocator; a warm-hop regression verifies
that dictionary, routing, and row reads share that working set without extra GETs.

| 1,024 existing-key presence probes | Scalar value reads | Sorted existence reads |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 256-byte values: local median | 5.771 ms | 0.526 ms |
| 256-byte values: extra peak allocation | 298,778 B | 160 B |
| 16-KiB values: local median | 1.287 ms | 0.693 ms |
| 16-KiB values: extra peak allocation | 16,810,398 B | 20,360 B |
| Retained value copies | 1,024 | 0 |

This isolates presence checks on warm immutable LSM runs and block cache using
modeled storage. It measures batch lifetime, excluding fixture creation and
disk latency. Different value sizes create different run/block layouts, so
cross-row timing comparisons are not a payload-size scaling curve. The native
batch probes sorted keys in 256-key pages, releases temporary pins and decode
scratch per page, and returns only booleans. Tombstones and batch-local writes
override persisted data. Non-LSM backends use their existing get semantics.

The separate default durable-LSM benchmark preserves identical topology over
65,536-edge insert/delete cycles: scalar presence plus per-edge global counters
takes 2.091 s, versus 1.277 s for sorted presence plus coalesced counters. That
comparison includes WAL and both directional commits and combines the two
optimizations; it is not an isolated estimate of the presence-check gain.

## Block-authenticated preparation and committed counters (2026-09-09)

Run `./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --indexing-only`.
At that measurement, graph wire was v6, manifest wire v21. Both ingestion paths emitted the same
authenticated block table, and the published manifest binds its control root.
Selected preparation retains authenticated semantic digests instead of hashing
the selected graph again. Each cold sample uses a fresh verifier, not a cold OS
page cache. Local filesystem timings are not cloud request-latency measurements.

Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0 ReleaseFast, shared host, after merging main
`9f192f9be`; six samples with the first discarded. Each reference prepares the same current-wire artifact and checks
the same selected semantic identity. Preparation excludes the numerical kernel.

| Phase | Reference | Current | Tracked peak / reads |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Stateful committed insert + delete | 1,719.468 ms | 980.983 ms | Endpoint counter reads 262,144 → 2,048 |
| Serverless narrow, warm identity | 12.781 ms | 0.107 ms | Peak 16,140,777 → 99,141 B; reads 11,780,488 → 115,080 B |
| Serverless narrow, cold identity | 12.759 ms | 0.105 ms | Same peak and reads as warm |
| Serverless all types, warm identity | 12.437 ms | 2.710 ms | Peak 16,140,777 → 5,854,947 B; reads 11,780,488 → 3,434,931 B |
| Serverless all types, cold identity | 12.625 ms | 2.480 ms | Same peak and reads as warm |

Two pre-merge runs had identical counted bytes and allocation peaks. Committed
cycles measured 2,150.950 → 1,198.386 ms and 2,158.953 → 1,185.736 ms; cold narrow
preparation measured 14.511 → 0.115 ms and 14.483 → 0.133 ms. All three complete
runs checked semantic/encoded parity across all 24 benchmark records.

Compared with the historical v5 run below, warm narrow reads rise from 19,677
to 115,080 bytes because of block alignment; cold narrow reads fall from
11,794,405 to 115,080 bytes. The source grows by 5,760 bytes for its block table.
Cross-run timing comparisons are approximate on this shared host; within-run
reference parity and counted bytes are the stronger evidence.

The committed-counter fixture uses 65,536 edges and 1,024 nodes on the default
durable LSM. Both paths execute six complete insert/delete cycles, discarding the
first, and check edge/node counts after both commits. Only global incidence
maintenance differs; topology invalidation, directional writes and WAL/commit
remain in the timer. Coalescing reduces endpoint counter reads per cycle from
262,144 to 2,048. This does not imply fewer WAL records: repeated mutable-key
updates were already coalesced by the LSM. Forced compaction, reopening and
fixture construction are excluded.

The block table costs 32 bytes per 64 KiB covered, at most 128 KiB for a 256 MiB
artifact, plus 32 bytes in each graph manifest reference. The existing eight-byte
ordinal edge index and dictionary/type directory are still present. Directory
control remains capped at 1 MiB, with an explicit full-preparation fallback.
Aligned reads can overfetch compared with v5's warm range path, but no longer
require cold full-object authentication. Actual overfetched bytes count against
publication's shared read allowance; separate filter groups share one control
object and retain only their own selected topology.

## Earlier v5 addressed plans and topology preparation (2026-09-09)

Run `./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --indexing-only`.
Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0, shared host; six samples, first discarded. This run
includes the merge of main `aa44bddd1`. That run used wire v5. The following are
local phase measurements, not cloud/HTTP latency.

| Phase | Reference | Addressed | Tracked peak / reads |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Stateful plan validation | 129.812 µs | 9.546 µs | Fixed 76-byte control; no boundary allocations on control path |
| Serverless narrow filter, warm identity | 12.296 ms | 0.074 ms | Peak 16,135,017 → 64,884 B; reads 11,774,728 → 19,677 B |
| Serverless narrow filter, cold identity | 12.538 ms | 4.107 ms | Same phase peak; reads 11,774,728 → 11,794,405 B |
| Serverless all types, warm identity | 12.509 ms | 7.490 ms | Peak 16,135,017 → 5,849,203 B; reads 11,774,728 → 3,181,277 B |
| Serverless all types, cold identity | 12.775 ms | 11.519 ms | Same phase peak; reads 11,774,728 → 14,956,005 B |

The stateful reference reads and validates the addressed boundary set as well
as the header; it models the old dependency on all boundary data, not the exact
old monolithic encoding. Both return the same plan identity. Each sample averages
128 read transactions on the default durable LSM. Production lease checks,
topology identity and iterative planning use only the control; initial planning
still materializes boundaries once. The generation-fenced census seals its
existing boundary slots rather than writing a second large final blob.

Serverless fixtures contain 16,384 nodes, 262,144 unrelated edges and 256 selected
edges. Both paths prepare the same authenticated v5 artifact and calculate the
same selected semantic identity; timers include that hashing but no numerical
kernel. The narrow path retains 256 node IDs instead of 16,384. All-types reads
use the same ordinal type runs, a dense endpoint map and coalesced dictionary
pages. Sparse selection instead sorts only its selected endpoints.

Warm cases verify source identity before timing; cold cases create a new local
verifier per sample, not a cold OS page cache. Cold authentication bytes remain
charged. Narrow reads still avoid full decode and retained topology, but cold
all-types reads increase I/O and show only a modest timing improvement. These
local measurements do not establish a cold cloud latency win. Provider/cache
allocations are outside the phase allocator. v5 adds eight bytes per local edge
plus a page/type directory to the existing traversal body (about 2.10 MB for
this fixture). This is an explicit secondary-index storage tradeoff, not free
compression. Page reads merge nearby ranges into at most 1 MiB windows, except
that one oversized dictionary page can be admitted on its own.

Ingestion parity remains exact between reference and ordinal encoders. For
65,536 edges, ordinal JSON-to-artifact medians were 16.791 ms with 16-byte IDs
and 28.507 ms with 256-byte IDs (reference: 21.682 and 61.939 ms). The streaming directory builder uses compact
node offsets and a bounded 65,536-entry digest cache, not an adjacency view or
graph-wide digest array. A million-node graph no longer loses its directory
because of the former 64 MiB scratch estimate.

The unchanged-topology republish measured 34 µs versus 2.871 ms recomputation,
with exact score/artifact identity checks. Stateful coalesced membership
maintenance measured 114.003 ms versus 528.457 ms per-edge maintenance; this
remains an abort-based maintenance benchmark, excluding WAL/commit. These
results do not establish the benefit of migrating stateful graph strings to
persistent numeric IDs: that separate indexing decision needs committed-write,
compaction and traversal measurements including dictionary maintenance.

The same run measured stateful filtered discovery at 0.573 ms using type
postings versus 12.636 ms scanning all 65,536 edges (4,096 selected), with
identical selected-edge checksums. Cold selected census planning took 66.969 ms
and three durable checkpoints versus 212.916 ms and seventeen checkpoints for
the global census. Census timings include plan reset and committed checkpoints,
but exclude fixture writes and the numerical kernel.

## Earlier v4 transactional indexing and directory-first reuse (2026-09-09)

Run `./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --indexing-only`.
Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0, shared development host, six samples with the first
discarded. These are phase measurements, not HTTP or cloud latency guarantees.

| Phase | Reference | Current | Checked work / memory |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Stateful membership maintenance, 65,536 edges / 16 types | 547.572 ms | 118.944 ms | 131,072 → 16,384 endpoint reads |
| Weight-only PageRank republish, 65,536 edges | 4.071 ms | 0.035 ms | Exact scores and prior artifact ID; 2,755,143 → 1,270 tracked peak bytes |
| JSON → graph artifact, 16-byte IDs | 27.550 ms | 16.489 ms | Exact current-wire SHA-256; 11,367,906 → 3,723,374 peak bytes |
| JSON → graph artifact, 256-byte IDs | 71.197 ms | 30.294 ms | Exact current-wire SHA-256; 43,562,466 → 4,214,894 peak bytes |

Membership maintenance uses the default durable LSM and aborts each all-edge
removal to restore the identical fixture. Timing includes posting maintenance,
but excludes fixture construction and WAL/commit. The reference is immediate
per-edge incidence maintenance; the current path coalesces endpoint deltas,
bulk-reads counts, caches encoded type prefixes, and uses already-known edge
existence only when the covering index is ready in the same transaction.
Scratch allocations fall 589,824 → 147,554; scratch peak rises 361 → 1,870,804
bytes. Backend-owned allocations are not included in that scratch measurement.
This is not an 8× reduction in WAL records: the LSM already coalesces repeated
updates to the same mutable key before commit.

Type postings and endpoint memberships are now demand-driven. Ordinary graphs
and unfiltered metrics do not create them. The first filtered plan activates a
bounded backfill; a durable activation marker keeps concurrent ingestion covered
across pauses, filter removal and reopen. Existing partial indexes are detected
before an inactive marker is written. A regression checks zero auxiliary posting
and membership records before demand, then exact edge/node parity after activation,
interleaved mutations and reopen. The timed membership fixture explicitly enables
a filtered metric; these timings measure active-index maintenance.

Private graph stores now serialize complete write transactions, including their
initial reads, across foreground ingestion, backfill, leases and checkpoint CAS.
Snapshots and numerical work remain outside that gate. Concurrent tests cover
memory, in-memory LSM and durable LSM; native LMDB retains its native single
writer. Commit failures retain the gate until abort, and failed opens release it.

Census progress is a checksummed `GPC2` control record plus generation-bound,
addressed boundary slots. A resume reads and writes no previous boundary bytes;
only the new page's boundaries are persisted. Slots are reused after a generation
restart and reclaimed on completion or filter removal. The long-key regression
uses 256 boundaries of 128 KiB: control size falls from 33,686,596 to 131,140
bytes, with zero saved-boundary reads/writes during an ordinary resume. Final
plan assembly still materializes the bounded boundary set once, outside the
write gate. Ordinary source/node scans also stop at their byte allowance.

Graph wire v4 adds a bounded semantic type directory and an authenticated-range
trailer. Both ingestion encoders produce identical bytes. Publication checks
this directory before source-wide preparation; unchanged selected connectivity
can reuse an authenticated metric even when weights, unrelated types, isolated
documents or qualified endpoints change. Source cardinality limits, policy
identity, cancellation and shared read/hash budgets still apply. Directory size
is capped at 1 MiB and construction scratch at 64 MiB; an explicitly unavailable
accelerator uses the same current wire, not a legacy decoder. Large dictionaries
and incomplete local topology use the normal preparation path.

The republish fixture uses a warm, content-verified local artifact store. Its
timer includes range reads, identity selection, prior control authentication and
publication; graph construction and score checking are outside it. Cold stores
may need full-content authentication, charged to the shared reuse-read budget.
Artifact-store-owned cache memory is outside the allocation tracker. First builds
and changed selected topology still prepare the source graph; the 116× ratio is
for this unchanged-connectivity republish, not all materializations. The ingestion
rows include constructing the new directory, making its extra encoding cost
visible rather than excluding it from the benchmark.

## Earlier benchmark series

Measured 2026-09-07 on Apple M4 Max, 36 GiB RAM, macOS 26.3.1,
Zig 0.16.0, ReleaseFast, using the system SMP allocator. One warmup and five
measured samples per case; tables report medians. This was a shared development
host, not an isolated benchmark machine.
The compact-query comparison below uses 21 measured samples instead of five.

## Ordinal-only numerical cursors

Measured 2026-09-08 on the same host/toolchain with:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --ordinal-cursors-only
```

Each fixture is a 256-node cycle in the default durable storage backend. Both
paths read the same sealed initialization and verify identical ordinal checksums.
The reference decodes membership IDs and validates their dictionary mappings;
the numerical path reads checksummed coverage and sealed leaf bounds, then
enumerates dense slots. Initialization and final publication retain dictionary
validation. Six samples per case, first discarded, 64 repetitions per sample:

| Node ID bytes | String/dictionary traversal | Ordinal traversal | Improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 16 | 211.796 µs | 101.843 µs | 2.08× |
| 4,096 | 1,180.156 µs | 207.796 µs | 5.68× |

These are cursor traversal medians, including read transactions, control-record
validation and allocation. They exclude graph setup, numerical kernels, writes
and publication; they are not whole-build speedups. The 4 KiB IDs exercise a
long-ID workload rather than representing typical IDs. Other development work
was running on this shared host.

## Durable cross-job topology reuse

After increasing default scheduling spans to 4,096 records, the same fixture
and command measured the following on 2026-09-08, before the ordinal-only cursor
change above:

| Complete numerical job | Physical edge records read | Checkpoints | Median time (range) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Independent topology | 32,768 | 36 | 1.612 s (1.415–1.887 s) |
| Shared topology | 0 | 22 | 0.834 s (0.811–0.892 s) |

The shared case in that measurement is 1.93× faster. Against the earlier
small-page run below, independent/shared checkpoint counts fall 638 → 36 and
110 → 22. Those work counts are directly checked. The historical wall times
were not collected in a controlled same-run comparison: storage compaction and
other activity on this shared host can materially change elapsed time. This
benchmark calls the low-level numerical runner; it does not measure concurrent
task admission or HTTP latency.

### Historical small-page baseline

Measured 2026-09-08 with:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --topology-only
```

The real default-storage fixture has 1,024 nodes and 16,384 directed edges,
with 16 neighbors per node. A first PageRank job prepares topology; a differently
configured PageRank job then executes one numerical iteration. The independent
reference forces a reuse-directory miss; the shared case adopts the sealed
owner. Both use the same implementation, numerical seed, and graph, and verify
every published score equals `1/1024`. Six samples per case, first discarded:

| Complete numerical job | Physical edge records read | Worker/coordinator checkpoints | Median time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Independent topology | 32,768 | 638 | 79.346 s |
| Shared topology | 0 | 110 | 18.573 s |

This is a 4.27× median improvement on this fixture, with 82.8% fewer checkpoints.
Times include planning, initialization, numerical reduction, publication and
job cleanup. They exclude fixture writes, score verification, and maintenance
of retired score generations and topology owners between samples. The reference
also includes the constant-size transaction forcing a directory miss. Sample
ranges were 58.172–105.075 s and 17.436–19.115 s. Compilers were running on the
shared development host; a profile of an independent build showed substantial
native LSM compaction work. These times are not an isolated-host throughput
claim, and longer numerical runs amortize preparation over more iterations.

Lifecycle tests additionally cover HITS-to-PageRank/eigenvector adoption,
producer cleanup and reopen, filter-set canonicalization, independent concurrent
producers, generation pins, deleted filters/metrics, bounded crash-resumable
reclamation, and rejection of retirement tasks targeting winning packed tiles.

## Adaptive decoded-score joins

Measured 2026-09-08 with
`./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --score-join-only`.
The fixture borrows one decoded 1,024-row block and verifies exact results for
each candidate count. Six samples, first discarded, 4,096 repetitions per sample:

| Candidate rows | Binary reference | Adaptive join | Improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 75 ns | 75 ns | unchanged |
| 16 | 431 ns | 434 ns | within 1% |
| 256 | 16.425 µs | 10.959 µs | 1.50× |
| 1,024 | 84.884 µs | 21.394 µs | 3.97× |

Sparse requests retain binary search; dense candidates merge against sorted
scores. These timings exclude decoding, allocation, authentication and I/O.
Separate parity tests include duplicate, missing and invalid row ordinals.

## Shared admission, sparse work, and publication checkpoints

Measured 2026-09-08 on the same host/toolchain with
`./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare`.
One warmup and five measured samples; medians below. Development tests were
running on this shared host. These are bounded phase measurements, not promises
about whole-build, HTTP, or cloud-network latency.

| Fixture | Reference | Current | Durable work / admission |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Publish 8,192 scores, real default storage | 423.880 ms | 96.506 ms | 128 → 2 score/staging/cursor commits |
| 100 sequential 80-entry routing working sets | 0.968 ms | 0.226 ms | 8,000 → 80 cache fills |

Publication compares 64-node and 4,096-node batches using the same current
producer helper. IDs are short, so the 1 MiB node-ID budget does not truncate
either case. Each sample opens fresh storage. Timing includes ordered staging,
primary scores, checkpoint cursor commits, and full primary-score verification;
it excludes numerical computation, worker page fencing, and final top-K merging.
Ranges were 419.238–430.928 ms and 95.571–97.751 ms. Actual production batches
also stop at their partition boundary or byte allowance; the fixture is not an
end-to-end 64× speedup claim.

The routing fixture uses the production cache and equal-size 4 KiB payloads.
A 64-entry-equivalent byte limit models the previous residency ceiling; the
current case allows 1 MiB. Leases are released sequentially. It allocates/fills
owned cache entries but excludes codec decoding, network I/O, and query planning.
Allocation count falls from 16,000 to 160, cumulative allocated bytes from
34,688,000 to 346,880. Tracked peak rises from 281,840 to 346,880 bytes because the
whole working set is retained, still below the allowance. Fixed inline cache
buckets are not heap allocations and are excluded from those byte figures.
Ranges were 0.944–0.987 ms and 0.222–0.227 ms. Separate regression tests retain all
80 leases simultaneously and exercise page-vs-metadata eviction under pressure.

The sparse stateful regression has 4,097 dictionary nodes but only three metric
members in two original leaves. Each later node phase now schedules two data
pages instead of 65; normalization schedules two leaves instead of 65. Empty
iteration-zero node pages receive no worker attempt. The test reopens at iteration
one and compares PageRank, eigenvector, and paired HITS output against the numeric
oracle. These are asserted work counts, not a timing benchmark. Original ordinal
identities remain unchanged.

The sealed-vector gather fixture still fetches only 128 storage chunks across
256 checkpoints (reference: 32,768). Its median is 16.888 ms, with 604,180 tracked
peak bytes. Cache entries and bucket allocations now draw from a shared 64 MiB
process pool, rather than multiplying a full allowance by every populated index.
Failure-injection and retirement tests verify that optional admission failures
and retired metrics release their charged bytes.

## Shared point planning and checkpoint-local folds

Same host/toolchain, one warmup and five samples, using the production helpers:

| Phase / scenario | Allocating reference median | Current median | Tracked heap peak, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Warm ordinal fold, 4,096 tiles / 1,048,576 edge visits | 7.496 ms | 6.230 ms | 12,288 → 0 bytes |
| Point row planning, 100,000 common-prefix IDs / 1 column | 17.537 ms | 3.622 ms | 1,600,000 → 1,200,000 bytes |
| Point row planning, 100,000 common-prefix IDs / 16 columns | 290.126 ms | 8.552 ms | 25,600,000 → 1,200,000 bytes |
| Point row planning, 100,000 hashed IDs / 1 column | 4.178 ms | 2.517 ms | 1,600,000 → 1,200,000 bytes |
| Point row planning, 100,000 hashed IDs / 16 columns | 70.889 ms | 4.672 ms | 25,600,000 → 1,200,000 bytes |

The fold fixture repeats a 256-edge tile with a warm source-vector chunk and
one target accumulator. Both paths perform the same compensated addition order
and return exactly equal sums. The reference owns decoded edges, source slots,
gathered ranks and contribution rows, using the same topology validation as the
borrowed path. Current execution also replaces per-edge target hash lookups with
a bounded chunk-local slot table. Across these edge visits, 16,384 allocations
and 50,331,648 cumulative allocated bytes become zero. Fixed stack scratch and
fixture/cache residency are **not** zero memory: fixture allocations are excluded
from tracking, while constant fixture setup is included in wall time. Storage
reads, cold cache fills, checkpoint commits and whole-build execution are excluded.
Measured ranges were 7.360–8.155 ms versus 6.011–6.528 ms.

Point fixtures use 391 routing blocks, deterministic permuted row order, and
either 30-byte collection-prefixed IDs or 16-byte hashed hexadecimal IDs. Each
path verifies the same row/block checksum. The reference retains every column's
16-byte row map. The new path admits 8-byte transient comparison keys plus one
4-byte shared permutation; the keys are freed before column preparation, leaving
only 400,000 bytes of row-mapping ownership regardless of column count. It uses
two allocations versus one per reference column. Integer prefix keys improve
both tested single-column cases; sorting full strings alone regressed hashed
single-column IDs and was not retained.

These are **sequential row-planning phase** measurements, not parallel column
execution or end-to-end query latency. They exclude output cells, control/routing
ownership, materialized block spans, score decoding, cache and network work.
Common-prefix single-column ranges were 17.273–18.224 ms versus 3.580–4.352 ms;
16-column ranges were 282.258–295.582 ms versus 8.319–8.814 ms. Hashed-ID ranges
were 4.078–4.624 ms versus 2.495–2.569 ms and 70.246–73.654 ms versus
4.133–4.898 ms. Sparse candidates, duplicate IDs, key lengths and shared-prefix
collisions change the balance; no universal speedup is claimed.

## Initialization and query ownership follow-up

Same host/toolchain, one warmup and five measured samples:

| Phase / scenario | Reference or cold median | New or warm median | Allocations, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Membership discovery, 64 nodes / 16,384 producer partials | 2.063 ms | 0.069 ms | 16,398 → 90 |
| 64 authenticated 64-KiB disk hits versus warm memory leases | 5.838 ms | 0.009 ms | 64 → 0 request-payload allocations |
| Top-K response conversion, 10,000 IDs of 4,096 bytes | 3.169 ms | 0.021 ms | 10,001 → 1 |

The membership reader is now used by vector initialization as well as iterations,
convergence and publication. This measures discovery and dictionary validation,
not a whole initializer, vector writes or a complete build. Maximum fan-in is a
deliberate stress case; fewer producer duplicates reduce the benefit.

Cache measurements use warm filesystem data in both cases. The cold-memory case
includes verification and promotion; clearing memory between lookups is excluded.
It is a cache-state comparison, **not an exact pre-change implementation**.
Allocation tracking covers request payloads, excluding cache-owned allocations.
Disk-hit times ranged 5.817–5.887 ms; warm leases ranged 0.006–0.010 ms across 64
lookups. Network and score decoding are excluded. A regression also verifies that
a warm leased hit succeeds with an allocator that rejects every allocation.

Response-conversion peak includes the still-resident input: 82,400,000 bytes for
copying versus 41,440,000 for ownership transfer. New cumulative allocation falls
from 41,200,000 to 240,000 bytes. Copy times ranged 1.227–3.237 ms, transfer times
0.019–0.022 ms. Input construction, cleanup, fetching and JSON serialization are
excluded. Long IDs stress the ownership boundary; ordinary shorter IDs benefit
less. These are phase measurements, not end-to-end latency guarantees.

## Sealed membership and output admission (initial measurements)

Additional measurements on the same host/toolchain (one warmup, five samples):

| Phase | Former path median | Current median | Allocations, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Canonical membership read, 64 nodes / 16,384 producer partials | 1.962 ms | 0.061 ms | 16,398 → 90 |
| Exhausted output quota, 50,000 nodes / 400,000 edges | 10.302 ms | 6.448 ms | 34 → 20 |

Membership uses real default storage and the same ordered dictionary validation
in both paths. It includes transaction and output ownership, but excludes fixture
writes and numerical folds. The fixture deliberately exercises maximum producer
fan-in: speedups will be smaller with fewer duplicate producer rows. Cumulative
allocation fell from 216,797 to 6,259 bytes; tracked peak increased slightly from
2,774 to 3,192 bytes. Times ranged 1.958–2.031 ms versus 0.060–0.063 ms.

Output rejection includes one source and projection preparation in both paths.
The reference computes and encodes PageRank before rejecting an exhausted output
quota; production rejects before numerical allocation or encoding. The symmetric
degree-eight ring can converge early (maximum three iterations); this does not
claim savings for three complete iterations. Cumulative allocation fell from
19,553,871 to 16,306,596 bytes, while peak remained 12,906,304 bytes because shared
preparation dominates. Times ranged 10.264–10.342 ms versus 6.437–6.481 ms.
Fetch, upload, rejection-sidecar encoding and cloud latency are excluded.

Metadata-tail skipping is checked as an operation-count regression: encountering
the metadata namespace issues one range seek regardless of the number of metric
records. No wall-clock speedup is claimed for that regression.

Run from `zig/`:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare
```

The executable emits JSONL including min/max time, allocation count, cumulative
allocated bytes, tracked peak bytes, and workload dimensions. Separate stdout
and stderr preserve the machine-readable measurements.

## Serverless topology preparation

Fixtures are directed degree-eight rings with 48-byte document IDs and one edge
type. Both paths consume the **same current v3 payload**. The reference decodes
owned adjacency strings, discards inbound edges, then compiles through string
hash maps. Production reads borrowed ordinal views directly. Fixture memory,
input payload residency, fetch, encoding, projection and numerical kernels are
excluded from this timed/tracked phase.

| Nodes / outbound edges | Reference median | Packed median | Reference peak | Packed peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2,000 / 16,000 | 1.580 ms | 0.163 ms | 3,668,016 B | 380,051 B |
| 20,000 / 160,000 | 41.258 ms | 1.484 ms | 36,680,016 B | 3,800,051 B |
| 50,000 / 400,000 | 121.782 ms | 3.498 ms | 91,700,016 B | 9,500,051 B |

At the largest size, preparation was about 35x faster and tracked peak
allocation was 9.65x smaller. Allocations fell from 1,750,046 to 11. Reference
time ranged 98.056–133.335 ms, packed time 3.474–3.617 ms.

The v3 payload was 16,100,033 bytes versus 61,500,014 bytes for the exact size of
the former string-repeating v2 layout: 73.8% smaller on this fixture. The
benchmark computes the old size formula; it does not retain a legacy codec.
Short identifiers, low-degree graphs, or many distinct edge types will have
different compression ratios.

## Non-serverless snapshot score reader

Fixtures request four distinct metrics over 20,000 rows. The reference recreates
the former bounded sorted-key reader with a per-batch key arena and complete
key construction per logical score. Production reuses encoded prefixes and a
key slab, and deduplicates physical rows. A synchronous mock transaction checks
key ordering and hashes keys; it does **not** model LSM/LMDB latency. Every output
cell is checked outside timing. Input fixtures and output arrays are excluded
from allocation tracking.

| Rows | Reference median | Physical reader median | Storage keys, before → after | Allocations, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| All unique | 6.593 ms | 5.358 ms | 80,000 → 80,000 | 4,625 → 6 |
| Each node repeated twice | 7.180 ms | 3.916 ms | 80,000 → 40,000 | 4,625 → 7 |

The unique-row case reduced median reader CPU time by 18.7%, cumulative allocations
from 13,421,150 to 715,200 bytes, and tracked peak from 838,608 to 715,200 bytes.
The repeated-row case reduced median time by 45.5%, halved storage keys, and used
795,200 peak bytes. Distinct logical aliases also share physical reads, covered
by regression tests rather than included in this timing comparison.
The unique-row production run included a 26.419 ms outlier (minimum 5.300 ms);
the duplicate-row production range was 3.898–3.948 ms. Use repeated runs on an
isolated host for latency guarantees, not these development-host samples.

These are phase microbenchmarks, **not end-to-end query or PageRank speedups**.
Production additionally pays for I/O, authentication, snapshot/status handling,
output ownership and numerical work. Tests cover default non-serverless storage,
durable ordinal jobs, serverless publication/query integration, cancellation,
malformed input, allocation failures and alias ownership.

## Admitted preparation and ordinal execution

The following measurements were added with the bounded census, admission and
compact-query changes, on the same host and toolchain. They exercise production
functions against explicit former-path oracles, not alternate numerical kernels.

| Phase | Former path median | Current path median | Scope |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Exhausted serverless projection preparation | 26.469 ms | 3.204 ms | 50,000 nodes, 400,000 edges; 16 rejected group attempts |
| Durable vector writer | 3.637 ms | 0.101 ms | 20,000 rows; synchronous mock storage |
| One-node score snapshot during rebuild | 194 µs | 103 µs | Real default storage; 256 active scan pages |
| 64-node score snapshot during rebuild | 638 µs | 553 µs | Same real-storage fixture |

The rejected-preparation case includes one packed source preparation, then 16
independent projection attempts against an exhausted work budget. The former
oracle constructs each projection before rejecting; production rejects before
projection allocations or census scans. This isolates admission ordering and
does not include the publication grouping/cache, fetch, rejection encoding, or
numerical kernel. Median time fell 87.9%; allocations fell from 123 to 11 and
cumulative allocated bytes from 35,600,691 to 9,900,323. Peak stayed 9,500,051 bytes
because the shared source preparation dominates it. This is not a claim that
rejection can avoid preparing the source itself.

The vector writer compares node-ID rows with rows already carrying their
job-local ordinals. Both execute the production writer and validate output
scores. Storage reads fell from 20,079 to 79, eliminating 20,000 dictionary point
lookups; writes remained 79. Allocations fell from 137 to 8 and tracked peak from
4,775,772 to 806,756 bytes. The roughly 36x writer CPU improvement excludes ordinal
discovery, real storage latency, adjacency reads, and numerical iteration. The
production reducer discovers ordinals with a canonical-node/dictionary range
join; the benchmark does not claim an equivalent whole-PageRank speedup.

The query fixture publishes degree scores over 4,096 nodes and 16,384 edges,
then opens a real 256-page rebuild. Both paths include a read transaction and the
same score reader; the reference builds operator status, while production reads
only publication/freshness metadata. Validation and result freeing are outside
timing. One-node median latency fell 46.9% (p95: 198 → 117 µs); 64-node median
fell 13.3% (p95: 662 → 640 µs). These are storage-level snapshots, not HTTP latency.
Runs overlapped development/test activity; rerun on an isolated host before
setting latency guarantees.

See [execution and resource ownership](../../docs/GRAPH_METRICS_EXECUTION.md)
for the associated admission, checkpoint, and integrity contracts.

## Staged stateful metric queries

Run just this case with:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --staged-only
```

The fixture seeds 16 published score columns in the default storage backend,
with 100,000 distinct node IDs. One metric orders the top ten rows; all sixteen
are projected. The eager reference loads every dependency before selection.
The staged path uses the production snapshot reader and stage workspace. Both
must return exactly the same selected ordinals and every projected score.

Final local ReleaseFast rerun (six samples, first discarded):

| Metric | Eager reference | Staged reads |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Logical score keys | 1,600,000 | 100,150 |
| Median execution | 17.575 s | 1.101 s |
| Tracked peak allocations | 29,233,056 B | 5,232,576 B |

The timer includes snapshot acquisition, score reads, selection, validation and
scratch cleanup. Fixture writes, traversal, response encoding and backend-owned
allocations are excluded. These are warm-cache results on a shared development
host with concurrent builds, not end-to-end latency guarantees. The reference
and current paths use the same byte-bounded physical score reader. The measured
work-count reduction is independent of host contention.

The preceding full benchmark run measured 21.108 s and 1.085 s respectively;
the difference between runs illustrates why the timing is a local measurement,
not a service-level guarantee. Both runs reported the same key counts and peak
allocation sizes.

## Sparse projection and resource-bounded iterations

ReleaseFast measurements on the same host/toolchain, with a prepared
1,000,000-entry dictionary and two selected edges (two active endpoints).
Each sample contains 256 repetitions; one warmup sample is discarded and the
median of five samples is reported. The inactive dictionary entries are fixture
placeholders; preparation, storage I/O, kernels and upload are excluded.

| Projection | Source-wide scratch reference | Active-endpoint path | Peak scratch, reference → current |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Degree | 795.582 µs | 0.179 µs | 8,125,065 → 73 bytes |
| PageRank | 830.437 µs | 0.218 µs | 4,125,097 → 89 bytes |

Node-ID and CSR checksums must match in every repetition. The dense degree
reference is the previous direct-count path; PageRank's reference retains the
former projected-edge copy (only 16 bytes in this fixture). These are deliberately
sparse phase measurements, not end-to-end speedups. Dense projections continue
to use linear-time maps/counts rather than sorting every edge endpoint.
Concurrent development builds were active; use isolated runs for latency
guarantees. The allocation and output-parity checks do not depend on timing.

Stateful iteration planning now eliminates later adjacency-producer pages
entirely. With 256 edge partitions and 100 iterations this removes 25,344
PageRank/eigenvector no-op page executions and at least 50,688 claim/completion
commits; HITS removes twice those counts. This is a deterministic work-count
comparison, not a measured storage-latency claim. Regression tests verify
absence of later producer pages, immutable adjacency reuse, recovery, retries,
publication barriers and numerical parity.

Serverless regressions also enforce two resource oracles: an 8,192-score prior
larger than 64 KiB can seed a sparse selection within a 64 KiB read/memory budget,
while dense seeds read less than the whole artifact by omitting ranked payloads;
and two concurrent requests for two cold routing pages perform exactly two
decoded fills even with 63 of the 64 fill slots occupied. The latter checks
shared lease identity and completion under fill-table saturation.

## Ordinal ingestion and selected-type discovery

Run `./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --indexing-only`.
On Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0, the following medians discard one warmup and
retain five samples. Each ingestion fixture has 1,024 nodes and 65,536 edges;
JSON parsing, construction and encoding are timed, input residency is excluded.
Every output has identical encoded SHA-256 to the old string-expansion oracle.

| Node ID bytes | String builder → ordinal builder | Peak allocated bytes | Allocation calls |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 16 | 23.250 → 17.474 ms | 11,276,518 → 6,228,850 | 438,315 → 162,863 |
| 256 | 73.502 → 30.934 ms | 43,471,078 → 6,720,370 | 442,411 → 166,959 |

The stateful fixture uses the default durable LSM, 65,536 edges and 16
relationship types. Selecting one type visits 4,096 postings instead of 65,536
reverse edges: 0.640 ms versus 14.110 ms. Selected identity checksums match.
This measures discovery only, excluding writes, migration, and numerical work.
The covering index adds one empty-value identity key per edge and its write/
storage cost; existing indexes pay one bounded backfill. These are local phase
measurements on a shared development host, not end-to-end latency guarantees.

### Direct packing, filter-local census and semantic metric reuse

The same `--indexing-only` command now also measures cold durable partition
planning and a weight-only PageRank republish. The following ReleaseFast rerun
uses Apple M4 Max / Zig 0.16.0, six samples with the first discarded. Other
development builds were active; timings are observations, not latency guarantees.

| Case | Reference | Current | Deterministic check |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Parse/build/encode, 16-byte IDs | 24.675 ms | 15.639 ms | Identical encoded SHA-256 |
| Parse/build/encode, 256-byte IDs | 81.795 ms | 28.786 ms | Identical encoded SHA-256 |
| Selected edge discovery | 14.362 ms | 0.642 ms | Same 4,096 edge identities; 65,536 → 4,096 visits |
| Cold partition census | 254.022 ms | 87.298 ms | 17 → 3 checkpoint steps; exact selected edge/node totals |
| Weight-only PageRank republish | 4.418 ms | 3.067 ms | Exactly equal scores; 2,362,369 → 0 projection/kernel work units |

Packing uses the old string builder as the reference. Current peak allocations
are 3,631,986 and 4,123,506 bytes, versus the reference's 11,276,518 and
43,471,078 bytes. Compared with the preceding ordinal builder's measured
6,228,850 and 6,720,370 bytes, direct count/scatter packing removes 2,596,864
bytes in either fixture. That allocation comparison is deterministic; the
preceding run's CPU timings are not a controlled incremental comparison.

The census reference is the former whole-graph planning prerequisite, not a
different algorithm computing a selected plan. Both use the default durable LSM;
timing includes clearing the old plan and committing all counts, boundaries and
checkpoints, but excludes fixture ingestion and numerical execution. The selected
plan has 4,096 edges and 1,024 distinct endpoints, independent of unrelated types.
The v2 index adds one reference-counted membership record per (type, endpoint),
with two incidence updates per changed edge in addition to the edge posting.
This fixture has 16,384 such records. Write/storage amplification is a deliberate
tradeoff, shared across all metric filters; this benchmark does not measure its
ingestion cost or the initial backfill.

The republish fixture has 1,024 nodes, 65,536 edges, a high-degree hub and repeated
edges, with a 30-iteration PageRank cap. Only weights change. Its timer includes
authenticated cached-source reads, topology preparation, semantic hashing and
publication; graph construction and post-run score validation are outside it.
Peak tracked allocations remain 2,755,027 bytes in both cases because source
preparation dominates the peak. Artifact-store-owned memory is outside that
tracker. Semantic reuse removes projection/kernel/output work, but still reads
and prepares a changed source graph; it does not claim a cold object-store I/O
reduction. The reuse assertion also requires the exact prior metric artifact ID.

## Ownership reads and adaptive type routing (2026-09-10)

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --ownership-reads-only
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --filtered-prefix-only
```

Apple M4 Max, Zig 0.16.0, five samples after one warmup. Diagnostic before/after
probes used ReleaseSafe, identical fixtures, and fresh readers without shared
cache. The checked-in harness also validates exact result identities and work.

| 100,000-edge hub / 64 types | Before GETs / bytes / inspected edges | After GETs / bytes / inspected edges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wildcard | 7 / 299,988 / 1 | 8 / 364,565 / 1 |
| kind00 | 10 / 496,596 / 18 | 7 / 299,029 / 1 |
| kind31 | 15 / 824,276 / 34 | 8 / 364,565 / 1 |
| kind62 | 11 / 562,132 / 34 | 8 / 364,565 / 1 |
| All 64 types | 7 / 299,988 / 1 | 8 / 364,565 / 1 |

The sparse directory adds 528 payload bytes plus block-authentication overhead
to this roughly 7.6 MB artifact. The kind31 probe's local median changed from
0.392 to 0.229 ms. Cold wildcard/all-type queries pay one extra authenticated
block read to resolve the indexed row descriptor; this is a deliberate tradeoff,
not an across-the-board latency claim. No network RTT is modeled. Both
directions, high-entropy fallback, eager reads, output admission, allocation
failure, canonical round trips and directory corruption have regression tests.
Reservation is at most 8 bytes per 16 row edges plus a 16-byte descriptor per
qualifying row. Encoding fills that reservation during its existing validation
pass; there is no additional graph-wide edge array or payload copy.

For stateful ownership exclusion, an empty incoming query at the first of
65,536 target rows changed from 24.053 to 6.624 ms, matching the last target's
6.693 ms. At 4,096 and 16,384 rows it changed from 1.724/5.637 ms to
0.442/1.630 ms. The LSM-memory fixture still incurs graph-size-dependent
snapshot/cursor setup; the graph visibility layer now stops at its physical
prefix rather than seeking through every later excluded target.

Operational counts now use maintained counters and a pending flag, with zero
allocation and no traversal. The previous exact status scan took 1.206/4.861/
19.212 ms at 4,096/16,384/65,536 retained edges and exhausted an 8 KiB allocator
during retirement. Exact diagnostic scans remain available, but are no longer
used by operational status, live replay snapshots or cached status refresh.
## Shared graph-impact planning (2026-09-11)

Run `./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --graph-impact-only`.
M4 Max, Zig 0.16; median of five samples after one warmup. This compares repeated
per-alias calls with one shared result using the **same bounded comparator**;
it is not an end-to-end before/after publisher benchmark. The source document's
text changes while its 16,384 graph edges remain unchanged. Document loading,
WAL IO, encoding and object publication are excluded.

| Aliases | Repeated comparisons | Shared comparison | Total allocation traffic, repeated / shared |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 7.254 ms | 7.233 ms | 22.8 / 22.8 MB |
| 8 | 57.368 ms | 7.627 ms | 182.1 / 22.8 MB |
| 32 | 237.413 ms | 7.351 ms | 728.4 / 22.8 MB |

Peak scratch remains 11.0 MB in both modes; sharing removes repeated work and
allocation traffic, not the peak of one comparison. The companion cardinality
regression verifies every retry deadline survives three polling passes at 65,
128 and 4,096 rejected namespaces and that deleted entries are reclaimed.

## Immutable page-tree update prototype

Run the normalized graph-plan and copy-on-write storage benchmark with:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/antfly-graph-bench prepare --page-updates-only
```

The initial fixture is a chain with one outgoing edge per source document.
One middle source is redirected to the first node. Each sample starts from the
same pinned root with a cold operation-local cache; the first of six samples is
discarded. Stored object payloads and fixture inputs are outside operation memory
accounting. These are in-memory artifact transport measurements, not remote
storage latency or complete serverless publication timings. Document parsing,
numerical metric recomputation and manifest HEAD CAS are excluded.

| Source edges | Initial tree bytes written | Update bytes written | GETs / PUTs | Peak operation bytes | Median update |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,024 | 206,732 | 173,950 | 9 / 7 | 392,370 | 0.613 ms |
| 16,384 | 3,278,554 | 141,306 | 7 / 6 | 355,665 | 0.386 ms |
| 131,072 | 25,756,046 | 225,740 | 11 / 9 | 415,355 | 0.489 ms |

The update grows with touched paths rather than total source edges. At the
largest fixture it writes about 0.88% of initial tree construction bytes. This
is not a comparison against the packed artifact's size or an end-to-end speedup.
The small fixture also exposes fixed page-write overhead; page sizing and
compression still need evaluation before the production cutover. This benchmark
does not yet include supernode replacement, remote latency, or initial-build
peak admission. The rerun includes namespace-domain page headers and overlapped
local builds; latency is not an isolated-host guarantee. See
`docs/GRAPH_METRICS_EXECUTION.md` for integration status.
