# antfly-zig

`antfly-zig` is the Zig monorepo for AntflyDB and the inference
runtime. The repository contains product packages, shared libraries, benchmark
harnesses, compatibility suites, and Python end-to-end tests that exercise the
same checked-in source tree.

Root-level Markdown files are design and operating notes for active AntflyDB
areas. Library-specific design docs live next to their libraries, for example
`lib/image/IMAGE.md` and `lib/audio/AUDIO.md`. Inference-specific design docs
currently live under `pkg/inference/`.

## Build Requirements

- Zig `0.16.0` or newer.
- `uv` for Python e2e suites and repository helper scripts.
- Optional native runtime dependencies for some inference features, such as MLX,
  ONNX Runtime, FFmpeg, or platform GPU support. The build detects available
  local support and exposes flags such as `-Dmlx=...`, `-Dmetal=...`, and
  `-Donnx=...`.

## Common Builds

```sh
zig build
make test
zig build antfly
./zig-out/bin/antfly --help
```

The inference runtime also has a package-local build file. From the repository root, use the
delegated root steps when possible:

```sh
zig build inference-run
zig build inference-test
zig build inference-wasm
zig build inference-bench-linalg
zig build inference-bench-audio
```

For package-local inference work:

```sh
cd pkg/inference
zig build -Dshared-lib-root=../..
zig build test -Dshared-lib-root=../..
```

## Tests

The default Zig test target runs unit, simulation, chaos, and checked recall
coverage:

```sh
make test
```

Focused targets are useful while iterating:

```sh
make unit-test
zig build antfly-storage-db-test
zig build antfly-storage-test
zig build antfly-metadata-test
zig build lib-image-test
zig build antfly-audio-test
zig build raft-vopr-test
zig build inference-test
```

The Make targets run aggregate tests with the patched Zig 0.16 scheduler and an
RSS budget of 80% of the detected cgroup or host memory. Set
`ANTFLY_ZIG_MAX_RSS` to an explicit byte count when a smaller local budget is
needed. From the repository root, use `make zig-test` or `make zig-unit-test`.

The Python e2e suites are split by product:

```sh
scripts/ci/zig-antfly-e2e-pytest.sh e2e/antfly
uv run --project e2e/inference pytest -q e2e/inference
```

The Antfly runner uses up to four pytest workers, schedules historically slow
independent tests first, and keeps shared fixtures on one worker. Antfly process
and cluster work has a separate concurrency budget of two. Set
`ANTFLY_E2E_WORKERS` and `ANTFLY_E2E_PROCESS_SLOTS` to tune those limits, or set
`ANTFLY_E2E_WORKERS=1` for a sequential debugging run. Test duration history is
stored under `e2e/antfly/.pytest_cache` locally and in the ARC cache in CI.
Session-scoped process fixtures retain their process slot for the lifetime of
the worker; transient function- and module-scoped fixtures release theirs after
their queued work completes.
The scheduler infers process ownership and fixture scope for the standard E2E
fixtures. Custom fixtures can place
`@e2e_resource("antfly_process")` from `e2e_scheduler` immediately below
`@pytest.fixture`; the fixture's effective scope determines its isolation
boundary, including indirect parametrization scope overrides. Package-scoped
fixtures stay on one worker for their package, while a session-scoped fixture
automatically retains a process slot for the worker's lifetime. Inferred
session identities are fixture-definition-specific; add
`lifetime="session", identity="shared_runtime"` on wrapper fixtures that share a
longer-lived process. Tests that launch a process directly can use
`@pytest.mark.e2e_resource("antfly_process")`. Tests with unusual sharing
requirements can use
`@pytest.mark.e2e_isolation("test")` or `@pytest.mark.e2e_isolation("module")`.

Some e2e tests start local binaries from `zig-out/bin`; build the relevant
binary first when running those tests directly:

```sh
zig build antfly
(cd pkg/inference && zig build -Dshared-lib-root=../..)
```

Model-backed inference tests may require local model fixtures or environment
configuration. The suite keeps those tests skippable when the required assets
are not present.

## Benchmarks

Artifact targets build and install into `zig-out/bin`. Run binaries directly,
so a comparison can build once and execute several workloads:

```sh
zig build graph-pattern-bench antfly-storage-bench
./zig-out/bin/graph_pattern_query_bench --mode exact --fanout 10000 --target-degree 100000
./zig-out/bin/graph_pattern_query_bench --mode generic --fanout 10000 --target-degree 100000
```

[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) lists binaries, previous smoke/stress arguments,
and the DB query matrix. Conformance fixture setup is documented in
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

Run each graph-pattern mode in a fresh process. The JSON output reports p50,
p95, and p99 latency and query-allocation high-water marks. Process RSS is an
OS high-water mark; use `--warmup 0 --samples 1` for a cold-query RSS comparison.

The `search-benchmark-game/engines/antfly-zig` directory is an adapter for the
external `search-benchmark-game` harness. It delegates to the root
`search-bench` step.

### PDF-only iteration

Build the native PDF machinery without the Antfly server or storage kernel:

```sh
zig build lib-pdf-bench -Dpdf-optimize=Debug -j1
./zig-out/bin/lib-pdf-bench dump-text input.pdf output.txt
zig build lib-pdf-test -Doptimize=Debug -j1
```

`dump-text` writes native UTF-8 text using the same page-text/region extraction API
as the production document pipeline, without OCR or server postprocessing. It
propagates page extraction errors rather than silently skipping failed pages.
Create the output directory first.

The isolated executable defaults to `ReleaseFast`; use `-Dpdf-optimize=Debug`
for short edit/build/debug cycles, and omit it for optimized benchmark runs.
`--prefix /path/to/run` installs a separate `bin/lib-pdf-bench` so baseline and
candidate executables can be retained independently. Also use a separate
`--cache-dir /path/to/cache` for each source revision, especially with cloned
worktrees: a separate install prefix does not isolate Zig's cached build graph.
Antfly's Circus `benchmarks/ParseBench-harness/text_content_driver.py` scores this
command's output against upstream content rules without running an Antfly server.

## Generated Code

OpenAPI-generated Zig sources and Snowball-generated Zig stemmers are checked
in where they are part of normal builds. Regeneration is wired through build
steps and scripts rather than ad-hoc editing. Keep generated output, caches,
downloaded models, and local runtime state out of commits unless the repository
explicitly tracks them.

Common generated/local-output directories include:

```text
zig-out/
.zig-cache/
.zig-global-cache/
.pytest_cache/
e2e/*/.venv/
pkg/inference/.debug/
```

## Development Notes

- Prefer adding shared, reusable code under `lib/` and product-specific code
  under `pkg/antfly` or `pkg/inference`.
- Keep package and library README files local when they explain how to use that
  component directly.
- Keep long-lived design docs near the subsystem they describe. Move stale
  planning docs into current design/status docs instead of adding more
  top-level files.
- Preserve build step names when moving benchmark or test sources; scripts and
  compatibility harnesses depend on those names.
