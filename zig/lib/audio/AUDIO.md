# Audio Support

Antfly inference routes native/server audio through `lib/audio`. The public boundary is
decoded PCM `f32` samples plus sample rate and channel count; encoded bytes are
handled as adapters above that boundary.

The browser path intentionally uses `AudioContext.decodeAudioData` for
container/codec decode, then passes PCM into Zig/WASM for feature generation.
That keeps browser codec support aligned with the platform and avoids shipping
large pure-Zig decoders to WASM before we need them.

## Public Surface

- `lib/audio.decode(...)` returns mono PCM and keeps the existing mono-first
  pipeline behavior.
- `lib/audio.decodeInterleaved(...)` returns interleaved PCM plus channel count
  for callers that need stereo-aware data.
- Transcription and audio embedding have PCM-first entry points; byte-based
  entry points are adapters.
- Format/MIME/filename helpers report only formats that are wired through the
  shared audio boundary.

All public interleaved decode output is normalized to finite `[-1, 1]` PCM.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Current Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WAV/RIFX/RF64/BW64 | Pure Zig | PCM8/16/24/32/64, float32/64, WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE, G.711 `alaw`/`mulaw`, RF64/BW64 `ds64` sizing. |
| AU/SND | Pure Zig | Signed PCM, float32/64, G.711 `ulaw`/`alaw`. |
| AIFF/AIFC | Pure Zig for common PCM/float/G.711 | Covers checked-in AIFF PCM16 plus synthetic AIFC `NONE`/`twos`/`sowt`, `in24`/`in32`, `raw `, `fl32`/`fl64`, `ulaw`, and `alaw`; unsupported variants now fail closed. |
| CAF | Pure Zig for `lpcm`/G.711 and checked-in stereo ALAC | CAF packet-table priming/remainder trimming is applied at the shared decode boundary, including ALAC `data` chunks that run to end-of-file and the checked-in 16-bit and 24-bit stereo ALAC fixtures; unsupported variants now fail closed. |
| MP3 | Pure Zig | Pure-Zig coverage includes checked-in mono, free-format stereo downmix, and mode-switching stereo vectors, plus every MPEG-2 and MPEG-2.5 low sampling frequency (24/22.05/16/12/11.025/8 kHz) including their short blocks. Silent frames decode to silence and a final frame the stream cuts short decodes from the bit reservoir, so a clip keeps its length and its timeline; only a leading Xing/Info/VBRI frame is read as metadata instead of audio. Unsupported MP3 shapes still fail closed, and a sample rate without band tables is rejected when the frame header is read rather than reaching the tables. Short blocks share the long blocks' IMDCT normalization, so every checked-in MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-2.5 vector now decodes sample-exact against the reference decoder. External fetched MP3 vector coverage is now being widened through the misc e2e lane. |
| AAC/ADTS | Pure Zig for a narrow AAC Main/AAC-LC lane | Supports checked-in long/short-window mono/stereo AAC-LC shapes, real mono PNS/TNS-gain fixtures, real stereo low-bitrate CPE/TNS fixtures, narrow MP4/M4A `frame_length_960` AAC-LC access-unit shapes, a narrow MP4/M4A AAC-LC core shape with SBR sync-extension signaling, payload-structure-aware sync-extension SBR/PS postprocess when a real `FIL` enhancement payload is present, narrow explicit HE-AAC/PS object-type long-window synthetic shapes via synthesized 2x highband enhancement, explicit PCE/layout validation, non-predictive AAC Main mono/stereo synthetic shapes, synthetic AAC Main long-window predictor-data coverage, and synthetic PS mono-core stereo output plus stereo intensity/TNS/gain CPE coverage. Unsupported AAC tools and broader enhancement-profile syntax now fail closed. |
| MP4/M4A/QuickTime audio | Pure Zig demux plus codec-specific pure-Zig decode for the owned AAC/ALAC lane | Demuxes checked-in AAC and ALAC access units/config, including the checked-in 16-bit and 24-bit stereo ALAC fixtures. Handles `stsz`/`stz2` sample sizes, direct or `wave`-wrapped codec config, QuickTime `qt  ` brand/`.mov`/`.qt` aliases, later supported audio tracks after earlier unsupported ones, and contiguous-media-edit plus leading/trailing-empty-edit `elst` timing for priming/remainder trimming; unsupported codec/container shapes fail closed. |
| FLAC | Pure Zig | Covers the checked-in native `.flac` 16-bit and 24-bit fixtures through the shared `lib/audio` boundary, plus the external `flac-test-files` sweep including the 32-bit `uncommon/05 - 32bps audio.flac` vector and the raw-frame-start/prefix-noise cases via raw-frame fallback. Only the intentionally malformed `faulty/` negatives and the intentionally unrepresentable mid-stream-format-change `uncommon/01-04` vectors remain expected unsupported. |
| Ogg/FLAC | Pure Zig for the narrow checked-in mapping | Reassembles Ogg pages/packets for the checked-in FLAC-in-Ogg mapping and feeds the result into the native FLAC decoder; unsupported Ogg/FLAC shapes now fail closed. |
| Ogg/Vorbis | Pure Zig, reference-exact | Shared Ogg page/packet parsing tracks BOS/EOS, packet boundaries, and the granule of the last packet *completed* on a page, and the Vorbis lane decodes headers, floor0/floor1, residues, inverse coupling, IMDCT/windowing, and overlap/add per Vorbis I. Every decodable file of the Xiph Vorbis vector set (including `singlemap-test`, `48k-mono`, `out-of-spec-blocksize`, `one-entry-codebook-test`, `unused-mode-test`, and the truncated `test-short2`) decodes at 107–120 dB SNR against ffmpeg/libvorbis with exact frame counts; chained streams decode every chain. |
| Ogg/Opus, Opus | Pure Zig, reference-exact | `opus.zig` owns `OpusHead`/TOC/frame packing, the range decoder, trim/gain, and the packet loop that mirrors `opus_decode_frame` (mode transitions, 5 ms redundancy frames, SILK-to-CELT mixing). `opus_celt.zig` is a port of the libopus float CELT decoder (band allocation, PVQ, anti-collapse, backward MDCT with TDAC, pitch postfilter, de-emphasis) and `opus_silk.zig` a port of the fixed-point SILK decoder (side info, shell coder, NLSF/LTP dequantisation, LPC/LTP synthesis, stereo MS-to-LR, 48 kHz resampler) with its tables generated from the libopus sources. All twelve RFC 8251 test vectors decode at 65 dB SNR or better against the reference `.dec` files for mono and stereo output, and ffmpeg-encoded SILK and CELT streams match libopus decodes sample for sample. Packet loss concealment and comfort noise are not implemented, which a file decoder does not need. |
| WebM/Matroska | Pure Zig demux into the owned Opus/Vorbis/FLAC lanes | Parses EBML with known and unknown-size Segments and Clusters, skips non-audio tracks, and reassembles all three lacing modes. Every block's presentation time is kept (cluster Timestamp plus the block's signed relative timecode, scaled by TimestampScale, less CodecDelay, which is the priming the decoder drops), and decoding puts the audio back on that timeline: a track that starts late, or a recording that was paused, keeps its silence instead of sliding earlier, so a transcript offset still matches where a player would seek. Gap insertion is exact for Opus (packet durations come from the TOC) and Vorbis (block sizes come from the packet headers); a FLAC track is placed by its start offset only, because frame lengths live in each FLAC frame header. Inserted silence is capped at ten minutes per file so a broken timestamp cannot materialise hours of it. |

## Pure-Zig Implementation Tracker

| Area | Status | Next Work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared PCM boundary | Stable | Keep model-specific feature policy in `src/pipelines/audio.zig`. |
| WAV | Broad pure-Zig coverage | Performance tuning only if profiling warrants it. |
| AU/SND | Common pure-Zig coverage | Add real-world malformed/edge corpus cases as found. |
| AIFF/AIFC | Common pure-Zig coverage | Decide how far to go beyond PCM/float/G.711 before falling back. |
| CAF | `lpcm`/G.711 pure Zig, checked-in 16-bit/24-bit stereo ALAC pure Zig | Broaden ALAC compressed-frame coverage beyond the checked-in stereo fixtures. |
| MP4/M4A demux | Pure-Zig demux for checked-in AAC/ALAC, including 16 kHz stereo, 44.1 kHz mono, and 44.1 kHz short-window AAC fixtures, `stsz`/`stz2` sample tables, stable single-description `stsc` chunk maps even when the selected description is not entry 1, version-0/1/2 audio sample entries, direct or `wave`-wrapped config atoms, order-insensitive audio `mdia` handler/minf parsing, order-insensitive `moov` `mvhd`/`trak` scanning, skipping earlier unsupported audio tracks when a later one is supported, contiguous-media-edit trim metadata | Widen ISO BMFF/QuickTime layouts beyond discontiguous edit-list timing and broader multi-track/container shapes. |
| AAC Main/AAC-LC | Narrow pure-Zig decode lane | Broaden conformance before claiming general AAC. Narrow MP4/M4A `frame_length_960` access-unit decode is now covered, sync-extension SBR now has a narrow payload-aware enhancement lane, and explicit HE-AAC/PS object-type configs now have a narrow synthesized highband/stereo-widening lane, but remaining hard cases still include wider real stereo CPE/tool combinations beyond the checked-in PNS/TNS/gain/short-window fixtures plus general enhancement-payload SBR/PS reconstruction beyond the current synthetic/object-type boundary. The AAC-LC lane now matches ffmpeg sample for sample on the checked-in ADTS/M4A/MP4 corpus and on ffmpeg and Apple encodes at 16, 44.1 and 48 kHz (short windows, TNS, PNS, M/S, intensity, edit-list and iTunSMPB priming). Known gaps: the synthetic SBR/PS enhancement lanes, the fill-element detail-hint parser, and AAC Main prediction state have failing tests that are excluded from `test-audio-internals`; real HE-AAC streams decode their LC core only. |
| MP3 | Narrow pure-Zig decode lane | Broaden Huffman/requantization/oracle coverage before calling it general. Unsupported MP3 shapes now fail closed. |
| FLAC | Narrow pure-Zig decode lane | Add malformed/real-world corpus coverage and more stream-shape coverage before calling it general. |
| Ogg container | Narrow pure-Zig owned codec mappings | Pure-Zig Ogg dispatch now owns the checked-in Vorbis, Opus, and FLAC-in-Ogg lanes and fails closed on unsupported codec/container shapes. Broaden packet/page coverage only if we intend to own more Ogg shapes. |
| Opus | Full RFC 6716 decoder, no PLC | CELT, SILK, and hybrid frames at every frame size, mono/stereo streams with mid-stream channel and mode switches, redundancy frames, and code 0-3 packets (including multi-byte padding) decode through the libopus ports in `opus_celt.zig` and `opus_silk.zig`; the Xiph sweep checks every RFC 8251 vector at 40 dB SNR minimum. Remaining gaps are packet loss concealment, DTX comfort noise, and multistream (`mapping_family` other than 0). |
| Vorbis | Pure-Zig decode, reference-exact | Validated stage by stage against stb_vorbis traces and end to end against ffmpeg and libvorbis on the Xiph vector set. The bugs that had kept it apart were all spec-reading ones: codewords must be assigned in entry order (Vorbis I 3.2.1, not DEFLATE canonical order), floor1 subclass books are stored +1, residue type 2 interleaves the submap's channels with its limits on the interleaved length, classword digits past the last partition are still consumed, the window flags are read from the mode's block flag (not from the block size, which breaks when both block sizes are equal), the dB table is the exact 256-entry one, the IMDCT is unnormalised, and audio starts at the first packet's centre. |

## AAC Notes

The pure-Zig AAC path is capability-shaped rather than file-name-shaped. It
stays in Zig when the stream uses supported AAC Main/AAC-LC syntax and fails
closed when a required tool or container shape is not implemented.

Implemented AAC pieces include:

- `AudioSpecificConfig` and ADTS header parsing.
- Narrow AAC Main profile support, including synthetic long-window
  predictor-data coverage, where the bitstream shape otherwise matches the
  covered AAC-LC lane.
- Narrow MP4/M4A AAC-LC `frame_length_960` access-unit support for the
  supported mono/stereo long-window lane. ADTS remains on the 1024-sample
  framing path.
- Narrow MP4/M4A AAC-LC core compatibility when the `AudioSpecificConfig`
  carries an SBR sync extension but the packetized LC core remains directly
  decodable at the container sample rate.
- Narrow payload-structure-aware sync-extension SBR/PS support when access
  units carry a real trailing `FIL` enhancement payload marker; the current
  enhancement step now derives small synthetic envelope/noise/stereo hints from
  the carried payload bytes instead of treating all enhancement payloads the
  same, now also derives narrow tail-byte detail/phase hints rather than using
  those later payload bytes only as hash noise, applies that structure per
  access unit across multi-frame decode, and when one access unit carries
  multiple same-kind enhancement payloads the later payload now drives the
  narrow postprocess instead of being merged into a synthetic max/xor blend, can
  preserve older unrefreshed hint fields when a later same-kind payload is
  shorter than the earlier one instead of wiping them to zero, now also does
  the same for shorter real refresh payloads in later access units, can
  carry the last seen sync-extension enhancement profile across later access
  units that omit a fresh `FIL` marker, now also keeps the last plain-SBR
  shaping profile across later PS-only refresh access units instead of letting
  PS-marked bytes clobber it, can also carry the last seen
  PS-marked stereoization profile across later access units that only refresh
  the SBR-marked payload, tolerates leading non-SBR `FIL` metadata before the
  first channel element, scans independent stereo `SCE+SCE` access units for
  trailing enhancement payloads too, and only enables the narrow
  sync-extension PS mono-core stereo lane when the carried `FIL` payload is
  actually PS-marked rather than merely SBR-marked; pre-PS access units in a
  later-PS sequence now decode as dual-mono until the first PS-marked payload
  appears, and stale carried SBR/PS shaping now decays across repeated later
  access units that only refresh part of the enhancement state or omit it
  entirely.
- Narrow explicit HE-AAC/PS object-type support for synthetic long-window
  mono/stereo access-unit shapes via synthesized 2x highband enhancement to the
  extension sample rate, including explicit PS mono-core stereo output and the
  same carried enhancement-profile decay across later no-fill access units once
  a real trailing payload has appeared; in multi-access-unit explicit-object
  sequences, pre-payload access units stay on the conservative pre-enhancement
  lane until the first real trailing payload activates the narrow HE/PS
  postprocess, and explicit PS stereoization now stays off for SBR-only
  payloads until a real PS-marked payload appears.
- Long-window and checked-in short-window IMDCT/windowing/overlap-add.
- Mono `SCE` and stereo `CPE` PCM sequence reconstruction for supported
  checked-in AAC-LC shapes, including real mono PNS/TNS-gain fixtures and real
  low-bitrate stereo `CPE`/TNS ADTS fixtures.
- Synthetic stereo `CPE` coverage that combines gain-control, intensity, and
  TNS payloads with trailing SBR `FIL` enhancement payload markers.
- Pulse application, deterministic mono PNS injection, TNS coefficient
  mapping/filtering, structured gain-control payload parsing, MS stereo, and
  intensity-stereo reconstruction for the covered lanes.
- Explicit PCE mono/stereo layout inference and element-tag validation for ADTS
  and MP4/M4A access units.
- Leading PCE/DSE/FIL metadata skipping, metadata-only access-unit skipping,
  repeated-PCE consistency checks, mixed-sample-rate ADTS rejection, ID3v2/ID3v1
  metadata around ADTS frames, and CRC-protected ADTS frame handling.
- Real low-bitrate MP4/M4A SBR config detection so the pure-Zig path accepts
  only the checked core-compatible shape and still rejects broader
  enhancement-profile syntax rather than mis-decoding it.

Still intentionally not claimed:

- General AAC decode.
- General HE-AAC/SBR/PS enhancement-payload reconstruction beyond the current
  core-compatible SBR-signaled shape and narrow synthesized enhancement path.
- Arbitrary object types outside the current AAC Main/AAC-LC lane.
- Broad stereo CPE/tool combinations beyond the current checked-in corpus.

## MP3 Notes

The MP3 backend is now fully pure Zig in both runtime and test/build paths. It
is not yet a complete general MP3 replacement.

Implemented pieces include:

- Sync scan, frame walking, header parsing, side-info parsing, reservoir-aware
  granule payload extraction, and region planning.
- MPEG-1 and LSF scalefactor handling for covered lanes.
- Huffman coverage for the checked-in fixtures, including table-zero regions,
  codebook-24 family, smaller table families used by the corpus, and `count1`
  quad decode.
- Requantization, stereo processing, alias reduction, IMDCT, hybrid overlap-add,
  and synthesis filterbank for the covered paths.
- Free-format frame-length inference, padding-aware free-format handling, and
  mode-switching stereo output for checked-in minimp3 vectors.

Remaining MP3 work:

- Wider Huffman and requantization coverage from broader corpora.
- Wider full-stream checked-in and external corpus breadth beyond current
  vectors.
- Decision on whether any higher-level caller needs stereo end-to-end beyond
  the shared interleaved decode boundary.
- More conformance breadth before calling the current fail-closed boundary
  general-purpose.

## Performance Notes

### Local Benchmark Baseline

> **Relocated:** The dated single-run benchmark baseline that previously lived here (28 lines, 2026-04-14) is preserved verbatim in [work-log/completed/audio/benchmark-baseline-2026-04.md](../../../work-log/completed/audio/benchmark-baseline-2026-04.md).

Run with:
`zig build -Doptimize=fast bench-audio -- --bench all --warmup-iters 2 --measure-iters 20`

Implemented SIMD/algorithmic work:

- FFT-based STFT replaced the old naive DFT mel path.
- SIMD dot product for mel filterbank accumulation.
- SIMD max/clamp/scale for Whisper-style normalization.
- Stereo downmix fast path for interleaved two-channel PCM.
- Direct WAV decode/encode fast paths for common PCM and float formats.
- MP3 Huffman primary lookup tables plus faster bit-window reads.
- MP3 full-stream decode scratch reuse for granule pairs, quads,
  coefficients, hybrid blocks, subband samples, and PCM staging.
- Vorbis codebook primary lookup tables plus faster LSB bit-window reads.
- AAC spectral/scalefactor Huffman primary lookup tables.
- Vorbis decoded-floor scratch reuse and precomputed floor-1 x ordering.
- AAC sequence filterbank scratch reuse for long/eight-short window buffers.
- AAC dequantization lookup tables for common `x^(4/3)` magnitudes and
  scalefactor powers.
- Shared AAC/Vorbis FFT-based IMDCT with pruned `N/4` power-of-two transforms
  and Bluestein fallback for non-power-of-two windows.
- Fused AAC long-window windowing plus overlap output so the decoded long-block
  scratch is not walked once for windowing and again for overlap-add.
- Fused Vorbis packet-window multiplication into timeline overlap-add so packet
  block samples are not walked once for windowing and again for mixing.

Pending only if profiling shows value:

- SIMD for MP3 IMDCT/DCT32/synthesis hot loops.
- Additional SIMD in codec-specific transforms once correctness is stable.

## Conformance

Checked-in fixtures live under `lib/audio/testdata`.

Current test layers:

- `zig build test-audio` for shared public audio behavior.
- `zig build test-audio-internals` for selected stable module-level codec and
  container internals.
- `zig build audio-open-corpus -- <dir>` for a repo-native non-MP3 corpus
  runner that checks files represented in the shared passing table against the
  pure-Zig decode path and the owned checked-in reference case, without linking the
  FFmpeg oracle.
- `zig build audio-xiph-corpora-e2e-fetch` / `zig build audio-xiph-corpora-e2e-run`
  for an opt-in external Xiph-family sweep over upstream Vorbis, Opus,
  Vorbis-tools, Opus-tools, the RFC 8251 Opus packet vectors, the legacy Xiph
  Vorbis vector set, the official Opus example-file sets, the small secure
  stereo FLAC master set from `media.xiph.org`, and
  `flac-test-files`, without linking the FFmpeg oracle.
- `zig build audio-misc-corpora-e2e-fetch` / `zig build audio-misc-corpora-e2e-run`
  for an opt-in external MP3 and AAC/MP4 sweep over public minimp3 vectors
  plus fetched public `.aac`, `.m4a`, and `.mp4` samples, without vendoring
  media into the repo.
- The shared checked-in non-MP3 codec corpus currently covers all 58 encoded
  fixtures under `lib/audio/testdata/codec-corpus`, with decoded shape and,
  where useful, PCM closeness checked against owned WAV references with explicit
  thresholds.
- The upstream Xiph-family runner now cleanly distinguishes
  `expected_unsupported` corpus negatives from real decode regressions, so the
  diagnostic summary is about actual parity gaps rather than malformed-input
  vectors we intentionally fail closed on.
- The current Xiph-family external runner summary is `success=124`,
  `expected_unsupported=10`, `unsupported=0`, `decode_failed=0`, `crashed=0`.
- The current active external encoded-fixture coverage is `flac-test-files`,
  the RFC 8251 Opus packet vectors, the official Opus example-file sets, the
  secure stereo FLAC master set from `media.xiph.org`, and the fetched legacy
  Xiph Vorbis vector set. The fetched Vorbis/Vorbis-tools/Opus repos still do
  not currently contribute encoded `.ogg`/`.oga`/`.opus` fixtures to the
  recursive sweep.
- A shared test also verifies that every checked-in encoded corpus file is
  represented in the passing table, so fixture additions cannot silently bypass
  the corpus summaries.
- The test suite also verifies that the shared passing fixtures and
  `lib/audio/testdata/codec-corpus/README.md` stay aligned in both directions,
  so corpus provenance stays consistent with the checked-in files.
- The shared non-MP3 corpus now also documents its explicit passing,
  decode-but-not-claimed, and unsupported lane ownership in the same style as
  the MP3 corpus notes.
- Unsupported and fallback cases are tracked explicitly instead of silently
  broadening support claims.

Conformance rules:

- Keep expected failures explicit.
- Prefer small checked-in smoke vectors plus open corpus runners for broad
  coverage.
- Keep external-corpus runners diagnostic unless the upstream lane is stable
  enough to gate.
- Do not claim a pure-Zig lane unless it is wired end-to-end and covered by
  tests.
- Keep FFmpeg as the reference oracle until the pure-Zig backend for a codec has
  broad enough coverage to stand alone.

## Non-Goals

- No attempt to reimplement FFmpeg wholesale in Zig.
- No attempt to extend Vorbis past Vorbis I (no floor0-heavy legacy
  encoders beyond the vector set, no Vorbis II) without a reference to
  validate against.
- No browser-side encoded-codec decode in Zig before there is a concrete reason
  to replace `AudioContext`.
