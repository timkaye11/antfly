# Hot Standby WAL Replication

This document describes the Postgres-style hot-standby HA mode built for the
supported Zig implementation of Antfly. It does not replace every use of Raft.
Instead it provides a simpler, efficient single-primary replication mode for
read replicas, disaster recovery, online upgrades, and deployments that prefer
Postgres-like operational semantics over quorum consensus. Hot-standby HA
shipped end to end (runtime, admin API, CLI, and Kubernetes operator) and was
productionized in the 0.2.1 release; see [Implementation](#implementation) for
the components and [Open work](#open-work) for what remains outside the
current scope.

## Empty instances and later table creation

The whole-instance stream uses explicit `--hot-standby-table-id 0` and
`--hot-standby-shard-id 0`. It can capture and activate an empty portable seed,
then replicate new tables before subsequent document mutations. The operator
must preserve these explicit zero arguments; omitted identities retain the
legacy catalog-bootstrap behavior.

The authenticated primary status snapshot optionally includes
`waiting_for_tables`, derived from the runtime catalog. It does not create
slots, capture seeds, or alter durability. The operator can use this signal for
opt-in asynchronous `OnFirstTable` activation; established HA remains active
when the last table is deleted. Eager empty-instance seeding remains the default,
and synchronous configurations must use eager activation.

Table creation uses version 3 JSON metadata records at stream identity `0/0`.
The payload carries the resolved table definition and initial ranges. The
standby persists those records before advancing applied progress. The primary
persists its local catalog and requires the configured RemoteApply
acknowledgement before reporting success. Startup replays catalog records that reached the WAL but whose
local catalog publication was interrupted. A WAL or local publication failure
fences the primary process until restart/recovery. A remote acknowledgement
timeout reports an uncertain client outcome while preserving the committed
catalog; replication can resume without restarting the primary. Inspect the
table before retrying an uncertain creation.

The shared mutation barrier orders table creation with seed capture. The
transition mutex and write generation checks order it with fencing. Both
members need a runtime that understands catalog records: older receivers fail
closed and cannot acknowledge them. Existing table-scoped streams keep their
previous catalog restrictions.

This adds table creation, including the initial table schema/index definition.
It does not enable deletion or alteration of existing tables, native auth
changes, backups or other surfaces still rejected by the mutation inventory.
Those require their own replicated lifecycle contracts.

`e2e/antfly/test_standby_empty_bootstrap.py` exercises empty portable seed
activation, two newly created tables, document writes, restart, fenced
promotion, unavailable-standby rejection and recovery of a catalog snapshot
that lags the WAL. Empty standalone catalogs are persisted before readiness,
so volume inspection does not need to interpret a missing file as empty.

## Summary

Antfly can support an efficient hot-standby design by combining:

- a consistent base backup of table/shard storage,
- continuous ordered WAL streaming,
- replication slots for WAL retention,
- read-only standby apply,
- explicit promotion with fencing and timeline changes.

This is a good alternative HA design when the product requirement is
single-primary availability with configurable RPO/RTO. It is not equivalent to
Raft unless Antfly also provides a strongly correct failover authority. Raft
bundles leader election, quorum durability, log agreement, and split-brain
avoidance. Hot standby shifts those responsibilities into leases, fencing,
operator policy, or an external control plane.

Recommended position:

- Keep Raft for multi-node consensus and automatic quorum-protected write
  ownership.
- Add hot standby as a separate `single-primary + standby` mode.
- Allow async and synchronous standby durability policies.
- Require fencing for automatic promotion.

Implementation notes:

- HA string validation is shared only at the missing/padded classification
  layer: `HAStringValidation = enum { ok, missing, padded }` and
  `classifyHAString(value: ?[]const u8)` in
  `zig/pkg/antfly/src/storage/hot_standby/validation.zig` replaced the old
  `paddedHAString` helper. Field-specific errors and type-specific validation
  for paths, node ids, slot names, token environment variables, and URLs stay
  local to each caller rather than living in one catch-all `validateHAString`.
- Type-specific validation is part of the HA contract: paths must be absolute,
  normalized, and bounded to the allowed storage root where appropriate; node
  ids and slot names must use a restricted charset and bounded length; token
  environment variables must use the existing environment-variable-name rules;
  and admin/replication URLs must parse as URLs while rejecting hidden
  whitespace.
- `zig/e2e/antfly/test_standby.py`, `test_standby_replication_startup.py`, and
  `test_standby_harness.py` are real-process Zig e2e suites covering primary
  startup, slot creation, standby seed/startup, primary writes, standby
  catch-up, read-only behavior, standby restart/replay resume, fenced
  promotion, and old-primary write rejection.
- HA is integrated with the Zig simulation harness
  (`zig/pkg/antfly/src/storage/hot_standby/vopr.zig` and `chaos.zig`), which exercises
  receive/apply crash windows, sync-ack crashes, duplicate/gap/out-of-order
  WAL, fenced and unfenced promotion, old-primary rejoin/rewind/reseed, WAL
  expiry, and timeline propagation.
- Hot-standby HA is productionized: runtime wiring, generated `/admin/v1/standby`
  Zig and Go clients, `go/pkg/operator` integration through the Go SDK
  wrapper, real base backup, sync commit, fencing, promotion/timeline/
  former-primary repair, standby freshness, WAL retention/reseed, auth,
  audit, metrics, runbooks, compatibility tests, and crash/e2e/operator
  coverage are all in place. Postgres-like WAL archive/PITR and
  cascading/relay replicas remain out of scope; see [Open work](#open-work).

The closest design model is Postgres physical standby operation: base backup,
WAL streaming, replication slots, timelines, synchronous commit modes, and
rewind/reseed after failover. CockroachDB is still useful as a source of design
discipline around explicit ownership, lease/fencing checks, protected retention,
and read freshness, but its core HA mechanism is Raft-per-range and should not be
copied wholesale for this non-Raft mode.

## Current Building Blocks

The Zig tree already has several primitives that fit this design.

The generic storage WAL in `pkg/antfly/src/storage/wal.zig` is append-only,
LSN-ordered, CRC-protected, truncatable, and replayable. It intentionally stores
opaque byte entries, so it can back storage persistence, consensus logs, or a
replication stream.

The LSM backend already persists mutable state through its own WAL path in
`pkg/antfly/src/storage/lsm_backend.zig`. `appendWalForMutable` writes state
records, and `replayWalIntoMutable` replays them at open time.

The DB layer also has sequence-ordered derived/change journal machinery under
`pkg/antfly/src/storage/db/derived`. That journal is useful for index/enrichment
maintenance and may inform the HA stream shape, but HA should replicate committed
database effects, not rely on each standby independently discovering or
recomputing all derived work.

The CDC design in `zig/CDC.md` already has an important precedent: checkpointed
snapshot plus streaming apply into the normal Antfly write path. Hot standby is
similar structurally, but the source is another Antfly primary and the stream is
an Antfly-native commit/WAL stream rather than Postgres logical decoding.

## Design Influences

### Postgres

Antfly should borrow these pieces directly:

- base backup plus WAL catch-up,
- replication slots for retention,
- timeline changes on promotion,
- explicit `remote_write` and `remote_apply` synchronous commit semantics,
- operator-visible lag and replay progress,
- rewind or reseed for a former primary after failover.

### CockroachDB

Antfly should borrow these principles, not Cockroach's Raft implementation:

- ownership must be explicit and machine-checkable,
- stale reads need an explicit freshness boundary,
- retention protection must be tied to consumers that need history,
- a node that loses ownership must be fenced before another node writes.

### Antfly

The HA stream should be Antfly-native. The stable contract should be a versioned
logical/effects commit stream, not the incidental byte layout of the current LSM
recovery WAL. The LSM WAL can remain an implementation detail underneath the
replication stream.

## Design Goals

1. Preserve the write-path efficiency of a single primary.
2. Keep standby catch-up sequential and cheap.
3. Make reads available from standbys when staleness is acceptable.
4. Support explicit durability modes:
   - async replication,
   - remote WAL write,
   - remote apply.
5. Avoid recomputing expensive derived state during normal standby apply.
6. Make promotion safe through fencing and epochs.
7. Keep the wire format versioned and independent of incidental in-memory
   layouts.

## Non-Goals

This mode should not initially provide:

- multi-primary writes,
- quorum reads/writes,
- automatic split-brain-safe failover without a fencing authority,
- transparent replacement for shard/metadata Raft groups,
- arbitrary standby writes.

Those features either belong to Raft or require a separate consensus/control
plane.

## Replication Model

Each replicated unit should be a table shard or another explicit storage owner
with one primary and zero or more standbys.

The primary:

- accepts writes,
- assigns monotonically increasing replication LSNs or sequences,
- persists the local commit/WAL record,
- streams records to standbys,
- tracks standby acknowledgements,
- retains WAL required by configured replication slots.

The standby:

- starts from a base backup,
- receives WAL records from the primary,
- durably stores received records before apply,
- applies records in order,
- exposes read-only state at an applied LSN,
- reports write/apply progress to the primary.

Clients write only to the primary. Standby write APIs must reject writes unless
the node is explicitly promoted.

## Base Backup

Standby creation starts with a base backup:

1. Create or reserve a replication slot for the standby before the backup starts.
2. Emit a `backup_start` record with `cluster_id`, `timeline_id`, `epoch`,
   `backup_lsn`, and `manifest_id`.
3. Publish a manifest that can be copied safely.
4. Pin every file referenced by that manifest, including SSTables, artifact
   objects, metadata files, and any local WAL tail required by the checkpoint.
5. Copy files to the standby, or materialize object-store references when shared
   storage is used.
6. Keep streaming WAL from `backup_lsn` while the copy is running.
7. Emit a `backup_end` record after the copied file list and checksums are
   durable.
8. Standby validates file sizes/checksums, opens the copied data in standby
   mode, replays WAL from `backup_lsn`, and reaches `backup_end`.
9. Release backup pins only after the standby confirms the copied files and has
   advanced past `backup_end`, or after the slot is explicitly dropped.

This should be compatible with local filesystem storage and object-backed LSM
layouts. For local files, copy SSTables, manifests, metadata, and any needed WAL
tail. For object-backed storage, copy or reference immutable objects and transfer
only local metadata plus WAL.

The key invariant is the same as Postgres base backup plus LSM manifest pinning:
the manifest must never reference a file that compaction or GC can delete before
the standby has validated and replayed through the backup boundary. The primary
must retain WAL from `backup_lsn` until the standby catches up or the operator
accepts reseeding.

## WAL Stream Shape

Do not expose the raw current LSM state record as the permanent HA wire format.
The LSM WAL is an internal recovery mechanism and may evolve with storage
internals. The HA stream should be an Antfly replication envelope with an
explicit version.

The initial contract should be a logical/effects stream:

- user document mutations,
- metadata/catalog mutations,
- derived artifact writes,
- full-text/vector/sparse/graph/algebraic index effects that must survive
  failover,
- checkpoint, manifest, retention, and timeline records.

The standby applies the effects in primary commit order. It does not run
mutating derived workers while in standby mode. That avoids recomputing
embeddings or independently scheduling background index work and gives the
standby the same committed state the primary exposed.

Proposed envelope:

```text
ReplicationRecord {
  magic
  version
  cluster_id
  shard_id
  table_id
  timeline_id
  epoch
  lsn
  previous_lsn
  commit_timestamp
  record_kind
  payload_codec
  payload_len
  payload_crc
  payload
}
```

Initial `record_kind` values:

- `batch_mutation`: committed document/artifact/index mutation batch.
- `metadata_mutation`: committed metadata/catalog mutation.
- `derived_effect`: committed enrichment, index, graph, or artifact effect.
- `backup_start`: base-backup boundary and pinned manifest id.
- `backup_end`: copied file list/checksum boundary.
- `checkpoint`: base-backup or manifest checkpoint marker.
- `manifest`: storage manifest publication marker when needed.
- `truncate`: WAL-retention/truncation boundary.
- `timeline_switch`: promotion marker for failover.

The payload can use the existing batch/derived encodings where appropriate, but
the replication envelope should be stable and self-describing.

## Apply Semantics

Standby apply must be deterministic and idempotent across restart. A standby
should persist received records and its applied LSN separately:

- `received_lsn`: highest WAL record durably stored locally.
- `applied_lsn`: highest WAL record applied to visible storage.
- `safe_read_lsn`: highest LSN available to read snapshots.

On restart:

1. Open local storage.
2. Replay locally persisted received WAL from `applied_lsn + 1`.
3. Resume streaming from `received_lsn + 1`.
4. Reject records from the wrong cluster, shard, epoch, or timeline.

The standby apply path should avoid expensive user-level recomputation. For v1,
the replication stream should carry committed effects rather than asking the
standby to rediscover them from documents. Rebuild-from-log can still exist as a
repair path, but it should not be the normal HA apply path.

Derived workers may still run on the primary. Standbys should generally keep
leader-only or owner-only background mutation jobs disabled until promotion.

## Durability Modes

The primary should expose a per-shard or per-table durability policy.

Policy should be explicit rather than hidden in a boolean. Example shapes:

```text
async
remote_write ANY 1 (standby-a, standby-b)
remote_write ALL (standby-a, standby-b)
remote_apply FIRST 1 (standby-a, standby-b)
remote_apply ALL (standby-a, standby-b)
```

`ANY 1` means any named standby can satisfy the acknowledgement. `FIRST 1` means
the first healthy standby in priority order must satisfy it. `ALL` means every
named synchronous standby must satisfy it. If no named standby is available, the
configured failure policy decides whether writes block, fail, or degrade.

Failure policies:

- `block`: preserve the synchronous guarantee by waiting until a standby returns.
- `fail_closed`: reject writes while the synchronous guarantee cannot be met.
- `degrade_to_async`: continue accepting writes and surface degraded RPO status.

`degrade_to_async` should be opt-in because it changes the durability contract
for acknowledged writes.

### Async

The primary commits once local durability succeeds. Standbys receive WAL later.

Benefits:

- lowest write latency,
- useful for read replicas and cross-region DR.

Tradeoff:

- acknowledged writes can be lost if the primary fails before streaming them.

### Remote Write

The primary commits after one or more synchronous standbys durably receive the
WAL record.

Benefits:

- protects against primary disk/node loss after acknowledgement,
- lower latency than waiting for full standby apply.

Tradeoff:

- standby may need replay time before serving latest reads or promotion.

### Remote Apply

The primary commits after one or more synchronous standbys apply the record.

Benefits:

- strongest standby freshness,
- simpler zero-data-loss promotion expectations.

Tradeoff:

- highest write latency,
- sensitive to standby apply stalls.

## Replication Slots and Retention

Primary WAL retention should be slot-based:

- each standby has a durable slot id,
- each slot tracks `restart_lsn`, `received_lsn`, and `applied_lsn`,
- primary keeps WAL from the oldest required `restart_lsn`,
- operators can cap retained bytes/time and mark a standby as needing reseed.

This mirrors Postgres operational behavior. A dead standby must not retain WAL
forever without an explicit operator choice.

Expose status:

- current primary LSN,
- per-standby received/apply lag,
- retained WAL bytes,
- oldest retained LSN,
- slot health,
- reseed recommended flag,
- last replication error.

## Promotion and Fencing

Promotion is the hard part. Without Raft, Antfly must not pretend promotion is
automatically safe.

A safe promotion requires:

1. A fencing authority declares the old primary unable to accept writes.
2. The selected standby verifies it has the required LSN for the chosen RPO.
3. The standby writes a `timeline_switch` record with a new timeline id.
4. The standby enables write ownership and leader-only background jobs.
5. Other standbys follow the new timeline or are reseeded if they diverged.

Possible fencing authorities:

- Kubernetes Lease plus storage-level fencing,
- cloud load balancer/control-plane fencing,
- a metadata Raft group that only manages ownership,
- an external operator that performs manual failover,
- a witness service.

If there is no fencing authority, promotion should be manual and clearly marked
as potentially lossy. Antfly should require an explicit force flag when the
chosen standby has not received all acknowledged synchronous WAL.

## Timeline Handling

Promotion creates a new timeline. WAL records include `timeline_id` and `epoch`.

Rules:

- A standby must reject records from an unexpected timeline.
- A promoted standby must never append to the old timeline.
- A former primary rejoining after failover must be fenced, demoted, and either
  rewound to the new timeline or fully reseeded.
- Replication slots are scoped to timelines.

This is the Postgres timeline idea adapted to Antfly storage.

## Metadata and Shards

There are two separate concerns:

1. Data shard replication.
2. Metadata/catalog ownership.

For a first hot-standby mode, keep the scope narrow:

- replicate a full standalone Antfly instance or explicit shard set,
- use one primary metadata owner,
- keep standbys read-only,
- promote the whole instance together.

For v1 whole-instance standby, metadata and data should share one ordered
instance replication stream. Schema/table/shard records must be applied before
dependent data records with higher LSNs become visible. A standby should reject
or wait on reads when the metadata applied LSN is behind the data LSN required by
the read snapshot.

Shard-granular promotion is possible later, but it reintroduces distributed
ownership and routing complexity. At that point, a small metadata consensus
layer may still be needed even if data replication is WAL-based.

## Read Behavior

Standbys can serve reads at their applied LSN.

Expose consistency options:

- `stale_ok`: read current standby state.
- `at_least_lsn`: wait until the standby applies a required LSN.
- `primary`: route to primary for read-after-write.

The API should surface standby lag so clients and routers can make informed
choices.

## API and CLI Surface

The HA control plane should be API-first. The stable automation contract should
be a typed, versioned `/admin/v1/standby` API specified in
`specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml`, with Zig admin API routing and helpers under
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/`. The CLI should remain as an ergonomic human and
break-glass interface, but long-term operator automation should not depend on
shelling out to a command as the primary protocol.

`specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml` is the source of truth for this surface and
should be treated as a new, dedicated admin OpenAPI spec, not an extension point
inside the existing public DB specs. New HA administration methods must not be
added first to the existing public DB OpenAPI specs, to
`specs/openapi/antfly/internal.yaml`, or directly to ad hoc Zig HTTP handlers.
The committed starting point for this contract is `specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml`;
it is generated as `antfly_admin_openapi` and surfaced through
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/mod.zig` and `zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/routes.zig`.
The implementation path is:

1. define the operation, request schema, response schema, and error response in
   `specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml`;
2. regenerate the Zig admin OpenAPI bindings;
3. re-export shared request/response types and route constants from the Zig
   admin package rooted at `zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/`;
4. implement node-local behavior by consuming those admin package types and
   route constants from the HA storage adapter. The admin package owns the
   HTTP contract, generated request parsing helpers, and shared route/type
   surface; storage HA modules own execution against local WAL, slots, fences,
   promotion state, and rejoin state; and
5. generate the same admin OpenAPI contract into `go/pkg/sdk/admin`, keep a
   small hand-written Go wrapper around the generated client, and have
   `go/pkg/operator` and other Go automation call that typed `/admin/v1/standby`
   wrapper. The supported Zig CLI should use the Zig admin bindings generated
   from the same spec rather than importing or shelling through the Go SDK.

The generated Zig module for this spec should remain the admin contract module
(`antfly_admin_openapi`) and should be surfaced through
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/mod.zig` plus route constants in
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/routes.zig`. Runtime replication handlers may import
admin types when they need to produce the same receipt/status shape, but they
must not define new HA administration paths under `zig/pkg/antfly/src/internal/`
or `specs/openapi/antfly/internal.yaml`. The internal OpenAPI spec is reserved
for node-to-node replication RPCs such as identify-system, start-replication,
and standby-status-update.

Recommended split:

- `/admin/v1/standby`: human and operator control-plane actions. This API owns
  replication slot lifecycle, base-backup orchestration, HA status, fencing
  receipts, promotion, former-primary rejoin, rewind, and reseed workflows. It
  should return typed responses with action ids, LSNs, timelines, fence tokens,
  receipts, and idempotency state. New HA admin endpoints and schemas should be
  added to the dedicated `specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml` spec first, generated
  into Zig admin types, and implemented through `zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/`
  routing/helpers rather than mixed into the public DB API or runtime-internal
  API.
- `/internal/v1`: runtime-to-runtime traffic inside a trusted deployment. This
  is where WAL streaming, replication pulls, standby status updates, identity
  probes, and other node-to-node mechanisms belong. It should not be the
  operator policy or human operations surface.
- CLI: a thin client over `/admin/v1/standby` for remote operations, plus local
  offline helpers where useful. CLI output should be derived from the same typed
  responses the admin API returns.
- Go SDK: generated client/types under `go/pkg/sdk/admin/oapi`, with a
  hand-written `go/pkg/sdk/admin` wrapper that follows the style of the other
  Go SDK APIs: it normalizes the admin base URL, installs auth/request editors,
  exposes stable HA methods, returns typed responses plus raw response bodies
  where receipts must be audited, and maps non-2xx responses into
  operation-aware errors. This should be the only generated Go client for the
  admin spec; do not generate a separate operator-local client. The Kubernetes
  operator should import this wrapper for executable admin operations instead
  of duplicating an HTTP client, hard-coding paths, importing generated `oapi`
  internals directly, or parsing CLI output. The wrapper is the compatibility
  boundary for Go control-plane code; generated `oapi` symbols are a transport
  detail hidden inside the SDK package. This keeps operator behavior, SDK
  consumers, and OpenAPI compatibility checks on one reviewed contract instead
  of creating a second admin API surface inside `go/pkg/operator`.

The Go SDK wrapper should enforce the same HA identifier policy as the Zig
runtime and operator admission layer before it builds operation metadata or
executes requests. Generated OpenAPI path helpers prove method/path compatibility
but they do not prove semantic validity: a replication slot name or node id is
not acceptable merely because `url.PathEscape` can encode it into a path
segment. Wrapper helpers for slot paths, node-scoped actions, promotion targets,
and former-primary repair should reject missing, padded, overlong, or
out-of-charset identifiers and should not silently trim operator input. This
keeps local CLI use, Go SDK consumers, and `go/pkg/operator` automation aligned
with the durable HA identity rules.

Runtime HA validation should be shared but still field-aware. Helpers such as
`paddedHAString` should evolve into a small classifier, for example

```zig
const HAStringValidation = enum { ok, missing, padded };

fn classifyHAString(value: ?[]const u8) HAStringValidation
```

Role validation can reuse the same whitespace and missing-value rules while
preserving field-specific errors such as `HAPrimaryLogInvalid`,
`HAStandbySlotMissing`, or `HAAdminTokenEnvInvalid`. Do not collapse validation
into one generic `validateHAString` function that decides every field's type
rules, silently trims operator input, or returns generic errors. HA runtime
identity and path fields should fail closed when they contain leading or
trailing whitespace, because those values become durable node identity, WAL
path, fence, slot, URL, or token-env configuration. Field-specific validators
should translate `ok`, `missing`, or `padded` into the right field-specific HA
error, then layer type checks on top of the shared classifier:

- paths must pass path-specific safety rules: absolute, normalized, and bounded
  to an allowed storage root where appropriate. Do not accept paths whose raw
  value changes after normalization, escapes through `..`, or points outside
  the configured HA data/backup root;
- node ids and slot names must have restricted character sets and bounded
  lengths;
- token environment names must pass environment-variable-name validation;
- admin and replication URLs must be parsed as URLs and reject hidden
  whitespace instead of relying on implicit trimming.

Admin authentication should be explicit but operationally simple. The Antfly
runtime may be started with `--admin-token-env <name>`; when set, the Zig
process reads a bearer token from that environment variable at startup and
requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on typed `/admin/v1/standby` routes. Health
checks and node-to-node `/internal/v1` replication traffic are separate from
this control-plane auth path. The operator should read its outbound bearer token
from `spec.highAvailability.admin.tokenEnvVar`, defaulting to
`ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN`, and the Antfly pods should receive the same token
through `spec.highAvailability.runtime.adminTokenEnvVar`, with pod injection
from `spec.highAvailability.runtime.adminTokenSecretRef` or `spec.standalone.envFrom`.
When `adminTokenSecretRef` is used, the referenced Secret key should be required
(`optional: false`) so pods do not start without the admin token. Kubernetes
should inject both process environments from Secrets; the operator should not
need direct Secret read permissions merely to call the HA admin API.
For human or break-glass operations, `antfly standby --admin-url <url> <command>`
resolves the bearer token from the environment variable named by
`--admin-token-env` (default `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN`, falling back to
`ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN`, when one of those variables is set) and sends it to
the typed admin routes. `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_URL` (falling back to
`ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_URL`) supplies the default admin URL when no target flag is
given. On the node itself, `antfly standby --data-dir <dir> <command>` opens
the local hot-standby state under `<dir>/standby/` (or a pre-0.3 `<dir>/ha/`
tree) directly and reads the log identity from the files, so no path or
identity flags are needed. The `--ha-url`, `--ha-token-env`, and `--ha-*`
identity spellings remain accepted as aliases, and the `--` separator before
the command is optional. Do not add a raw token CLI flag; tokens should not be
exposed through process argv.
If the operator ever uses a CLI-backed HA admin Job for compatibility or
pod-local workflows against an authenticated admin endpoint, it should pass
`--admin-token-env` only when `spec.highAvailability.admin.tokenEnvVar` is
explicitly configured and should inject that variable into the Job with
`spec.highAvailability.admin.envFrom`. Direct operator SDK calls may continue to
default to `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN` from the operator process environment.

The admin API is node-local even though it is typed and operator-facing. The
operator must choose the target node deliberately:

- primary-scoped actions such as slot create/drop/pause/resume, retention
  inspection, standby seed scheduling, and reseed marking target the current
  primary's admin URL;
- standby-scoped actions such as bootstrap-seed, promotion readiness checks, and
  promotion target the selected standby's admin URL;
- former-primary rewind targets the former primary's admin URL because it needs
  that node's local WAL/storage state;
- former-primary reseed coordination targets the current primary when it marks
  a slot or publishes a new seed, and uses a pod-local CLI helper only for the
  actual local data replacement step on the former primary.

This targeting rule is part of the production contract. A successful HTTP call
to the wrong node is not enough evidence for failover automation; typed
responses must include the acted-on node id, timeline, epoch, LSNs, fence token
or receipt, and idempotency state so the operator can prove the intended node
performed the intended step. The Kubernetes operator should publish the expected
node-local executor as `status.haStatus.plannedActions[].adminNodeID` and reject
typed action receipts whose `action.node_id` does not match it.

Kubernetes Jobs that run `antfly standby ...` are acceptable as a bootstrap mechanism
for workflows that need pod-local volume mounts or shared backup files. They
should not become the only production automation path. The operator should move
toward typed `/admin/v1/standby` calls for idempotent actions and reserve CLI Jobs
for explicitly local file-transfer or recovery steps.

### Implementation Guardrails

#### Review Decisions

The review outcome is to keep HA validation, e2e coverage, simulation coverage,
and the production bar explicit in the design. The implementation should not
treat these as nice-to-have cleanup after the storage path streams records.

Treat these review points as acceptance gates, not follow-up polish:

- `classifyHAString` can land before the full HA runtime, but it must preserve
  field-specific errors and never silently trim durable HA identity, WAL path,
  fence, slot, URL, or token-env configuration.
- The shared string validator should be a classifier, not a catch-all
  `validateHAString` that decides every field's type rules. Each caller should
  translate `ok`, `missing`, or `padded` into the right field-specific HA error,
  then run type-specific validation for paths, node ids, slot names, token env
  vars, and URLs.
- `test_standby.py` must prove a real primary/standby process path, not just
  argument validation.
- Zig simulation coverage must own crash, replay, partition, promotion, rejoin,
  rewind, reseed, retention-expiry, and timeline-switch correctness.
- Production readiness requires the failure cases to be first-class before
  automatic promotion or synchronous commit is advertised as supported.

The concrete follow-up decisions are:

- Replace `paddedHAString` with a small shared `HAStringValidation` classifier
  rather than a catch-all `validateHAString`. Keep durable HA string handling
  generic only for `ok`, `missing`, and `padded`, then have each caller map that
  result to field-specific errors and type-specific validation.
- Add `test_standby.py` as a real-process e2e, not just a CLI or validation
  test. It should cover primary startup, slot creation, standby seed, standby
  startup, primary writes, standby catch-up, read-only standby behavior,
  standby restart/replay, and later fenced promotion plus old-primary write
  rejection.
- Integrate HA with Zig simulation tests before treating the mode as safe.
  Sim coverage should exercise receive/apply crashes, primary crash before and
  after sync ack, duplicate/gap/out-of-order WAL, promotion with and without
  fences, old-primary rejoin, rewind, reseed, retained-WAL expiry, and timeline
  switch propagation.
- Do not advertise production-grade Postgres-style HA parity until the runtime
  wiring, generated `/admin/v1/standby` Zig and Go clients, `go/pkg/operator`
  integration, real base backup, synchronous commit, fencing, promotion
  receipts, standby freshness, retention/reseed handling, auth, audit, metrics,
  runbooks, compatibility tests, crash/e2e/operator coverage, and former-primary
  repair paths are all implemented and tested.

#### Acceptance Checklist

Before the hot-standby design is treated as more than an experimental async
replication path, the implementation should satisfy this checklist:

- shared HA string handling uses `classifyHAString` for missing/padded
  detection, while every caller preserves field-specific errors and applies
  type-specific validation for paths, node ids, slot names, token env vars, and
  URLs;
- `test_standby.py` exists as a real-process Zig e2e covering primary startup,
  slot creation, standby seeding, standby startup, primary writes, standby
  catch-up, read-only standby behavior, standby restart, and replay resume;
- Zig simulation tests cover receive/apply crash points, primary crash before
  and after synchronous acknowledgement, duplicate/gap/out-of-order WAL,
  promotion with and without fence evidence, old-primary rejoin, rewind, reseed,
  WAL-retention expiry, and timeline switch propagation;
- production-grade scope includes the generated `/admin/v1/standby` Zig and Go
  clients, `go/pkg/operator` integration through the Go SDK wrapper, real
  base-backup/reseed workflows, synchronous commit modes, fencing, promotion
  receipts, former-primary repair, standby freshness controls, WAL retention
  policy, auth, auditability, metrics, runbooks, compatibility tests, crash
  tests, black-box e2e, and operator e2e;
- bulk Postgres-style parity is not claimed until the former-primary repair,
  synchronous commit, observability, operator workflow, and optional
  WAL-archive/PITR or relay-replica gaps are explicit product decisions rather
  than implicit omissions.

#### Open Review Question Answers

The direct answers to the HA review questions are:

- `paddedHAString` should become a shared classifier, but not a catch-all
  `validateHAString` that owns every HA input policy.
- `test_standby.py` should be added as a black-box Zig e2e once the real admin
  API and runtime path are usable.
- HA must be integrated with Zig simulation tests because the sim layer is
  where crash, replay, promotion, fencing, and retention correctness should be
  explored exhaustively.
- The mode is not production grade, or close to bulk Postgres HA parity, until
  runtime wiring, generated admin clients, operator integration, real
  base-backup/reseed, sync commit, fencing, former-primary repair, observability,
  compatibility, e2e, operator e2e, and crash/sim coverage are all in place.

These answers imply a concrete implementation boundary: Antfly should share the
cheap string classification logic, not hide all HA validation behind one generic
validator. A generic `validateHAString` name is too broad because paths, node
ids, slot names, URLs, and token environment variables have different safety
rules and different user-facing error types. The shared helper should only
answer whether a value is present and whether its exact bytes include forbidden
leading or trailing whitespace; the caller must still apply the field-specific
policy. That keeps the code reusable without making operator-visible failures
generic or silently normalizing durable HA identity.

The HA string helper should be generic only at the whitespace/presence
classification layer:

```zig
const HAStringValidation = enum { ok, missing, padded };

fn classifyHAString(value: ?[]const u8) HAStringValidation
```

Callers should translate `missing` and `padded` into field-specific errors such
as `HAPrimaryLogInvalid`, `HAStandbySlotMissing`, or the matching token-env,
slot, URL, path, or node-id error. They should then run type-specific
validation instead of putting all HA input policy into one generic
`validateHAString` function:

- paths must be absolute, normalized, and under the allowed storage root;
- node ids and replication slot names must have restricted charset and length;
- admin token environment variable names must use the existing env-var-name
  validation rules;
- admin and replication URLs must parse as URLs and reject hidden whitespace.

`test_standby.py` belongs in the e2e suite once the admin API and runtime wiring
are usable as real black-box process surfaces. Its first product-path version
should start a primary, create a slot, seed a standby, start the standby, write
to the primary, verify standby catch-up and read-only/stale-read status, restart
the standby, and verify replay resumes. Later versions should add fenced
promotion, forced-promotion receipts, old-primary write rejection, and
rewind-or-reseed behavior.

Zig simulation coverage is mandatory before this mode is treated as safe. It
should cover crash after receive before apply, crash after apply before ack,
primary crash before and after sync ack, duplicate/gap/out-of-order WAL records,
promotion with and without fence evidence, old-primary rejoin, rewind, reseed,
retained-WAL expiry forcing reseed, and timeline switch propagation.

Production-grade Postgres-style parity requires more than streaming records. The
bulk feature-parity bar includes end-to-end primary/standby runtime wiring,
generated `/admin/v1/standby` Zig and Go SDK clients, `go/pkg/operator` integration,
real base-backup and seed workflows, `remote_write` and `remote_apply`
synchronous commit policies, hard-to-misuse fencing, promotion/timeline
switch/former-primary repair, standby freshness controls, WAL retention and
reseed status, auth, auditability, metrics, runbooks, format compatibility
tests, black-box e2e, operator e2e, and crash/simulation coverage.

## Operator CLI and Configuration

This section records the design of the `antfly standby` command (`antfly ha`
is a deprecated alias) and the `hot_standby` config section (the deprecated
`ha` key is still read) as they exist after the v0.3 naming pass. The goal was
the PostgreSQL shape: identity and paths are written once, tools derive
everything else from the data directory or the config file, and the verbs an
operator types match the vocabulary of `pg_ctl promote`, `pg_rewind`, `repmgr
standby follow`, and `patronictl switchover`. The four availability modes are
summarized in `STORAGE.md`, and hot standby is the only one with
hand-operated verbs.

### Naming

The command, config section, and admin API used the noun `ha` through v0.2.x.
That was ambiguous: Raft replication, Lite's fsync durability, and serverless
object storage are also availability stories, and `STORAGE.md` lists all four.
This release renames the surface to **`standby`**:

| Surface | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| CLI | `antfly ha` | `antfly standby` (`ha` kept as a hidden alias for one minor) |
| Config section | `ha:` | `hot_standby:` (covers both roles; PostgreSQL's `hot_standby` is the precedent; `ha:` is still read) |
| Admin API | `/admin/v1/ha/...`, `/ha/v1/health`, `/ha/v1/ready` | `/admin/v1/standby/...`, `/standby/v1/health`, `/standby/v1/ready`; old paths served as aliases for one minor |
| Schemas and SDKs | `HAIdentity`, `HAFenceReceipt`, `HAStandbySnapshot`, ... | `StandbyIdentity`, `StandbyFenceReceipt`, `StandbySnapshot`, ... |
| Operator CRD | `spec.highAvailability` | unchanged; a CRD field rename needs a new API version and conversion, and `highAvailability` remains a sensible umbrella |
| Admin token env | `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN` | `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN` added as the preferred name; `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN` still works as a fallback |
| Metrics | subsystem `ha` | `standby`, dual-emitted during the deprecation window |
| Internal replication API | `/internal/v1/ha/replication/...`, `HAIdentity`, `HAReplicationFrame`, ... | `/internal/v1/standby/replication/...`, `StandbyIdentity`, `StandbyReplicationFrame`, ...; the old prefix is served as an alias and a new standby falls back to it once when its primary still runs 0.2, so either side may be upgraded first |
| Internal package | `storage/ha` | `storage/hot_standby` (`storage.hot_standby` in Zig; test names and build steps follow: `antfly-storage-hot-standby-test`) |
| Server flags | `antfly standalone --ha-primary-log`, `--ha-standby-log`, `--ha-cluster-id`, ... | `--hot-standby-primary-log`, `--hot-standby-log`, `--hot-standby-cluster-id`, ...: `--ha-standby-X` becomes `--hot-standby-X` (the role segment collapses like the routes), `--ha-primary-X` becomes `--hot-standby-primary-X`, every other `--ha-X` becomes `--hot-standby-X`; the `--ha-*` spellings stay as aliases for one minor and the operator keeps generating them until its minimum server has the new ones |
| Data directory | `<data-dir>/ha/{primary.wal,slots,standby.wal,standby-progress.wal,fence.wal}` | `<data-dir>/standby/{primary.wal,slots,log.wal,progress.wal,fence.wal}`; `antfly standby --data-dir` prefers the new tree and falls back to an existing `ha/` tree; a 0.3 server migrates an `ha/` tree to `standby/` once at startup when its flags point at the new tree, and the operator switches a cluster's default pod paths to `/antflydb/standby/` once it has seen the cluster's nodes speak the 0.3 admin API (`status.haStatus.dataLayout`) |
| Server metrics | `antfly_ha_*` | `antfly_standby_*`, dual-emitted with the old names for one minor |
| OpenAPI tags | `ha`, `ha-replication` ("HA Replication") | `standby`, `standby-replication` ("Hot Standby", "Hot Standby Replication") |
| Config schemas | `HotStandbyPrimaryRoleConfig`, `HotStandbyStandbyRoleConfig` | `HotStandbyPrimaryConfig`, `HotStandbyStandbyConfig` (mirror the `hot_standby.primary` / `hot_standby.standby` keys) |
| Command source | `cmd/ha.zig`, `antfly.ha`, test root `ha cmd` | `cmd/standby.zig`, `antfly.hot_standby`, test root `standby cmd` |

`replication` was considered and rejected because it already names three
different things in Antfly: `replication_factor` (Raft replicas of a shard),
`replication_sources` and the `ReplicationSource*` schemas (CDC from
PostgreSQL), and the replication slots and log of this feature. A user who
sets `replication_sources` on a table and then runs `antfly replication
status` would reasonably assume they are the same mechanism. `standby` is the
one noun nothing else uses, it is what PostgreSQL's documentation calls the
feature, and it already matches the CRD (`spec.highAvailability.standbys`),
the schemas, and this document's filename. The verbs read as they do in
repmgr: `antfly standby promote`, `antfly standby follow`, `antfly standby
switchover`.

### Compatibility

The old CLI name (`antfly ha`), the old config key (`ha:`), the old admin API
paths (`/admin/v1/ha/...`, `/ha/v1/health`, `/ha/v1/ready`), and the old
environment variable names (`ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_URL`, `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN`)
all continue to work for one minor release and are scheduled for removal in
0.4. Every client negotiates rather than assuming: the CLI, a replicating
standby, and the Kubernetes operator (Go SDK `PathStyleAuto`, the operator's
`--standby-admin-path-style=auto` default) send the canonical path first and fall
back to the old spelling once on an unrouted 404, remembering the answer per
peer. Either side of a primary/standby pair, or of an operator/server pair,
can therefore be upgraded first. The operator reads its own token from
`ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN` with `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN` as the fallback; the
variable it injects into managed pods keeps the old default name, because that
is a CRD-visible default and renaming it would roll every cluster.

### Target resolution

Every `antfly standby` invocation (`antfly ha` is a deprecated alias) resolves
exactly one target before the verb runs. Local targets open the node's WAL,
slot store, and fence store directly and are meant for a stopped node or
break-glass repair; remote targets speak to a running node's
`/admin/v1/standby` API (the old `/admin/v1/ha` path is served as an alias)
and are the normal path. Precedence, highest first:

1. Explicit flags: `--admin-url` (remote) or any local handle flag
   (`--primary-log`, `--standby-log`, `--fence-wal`, ...). The `--ha-*` spellings
   are accepted as aliases.
2. Environment: `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_URL` (falling back to the deprecated
   `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_URL`) supplies a remote target when no flag chose one;
   `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN` (falling back to `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN`), when
   set, supplies the token variable for any remote target that lacks
   `--admin-token-env`. This follows the `ANTFLY_URL`/`ANTFLY_TOKEN` convention
   of the data-plane CLI.
3. Config file: `--config <file>` reads the server's `hot_standby` section (the
   deprecated `ha` section is still read). If it names
   `hot_standby.admin.url`, the command is remote, because a node with a
   configured admin endpoint is expected to be running and to own its files.
   Otherwise the section's paths and identity become local handles.
   `hot_standby.admin.token_env` fills the token variable for any remote
   target.
4. Data directory: `--data-dir <dir>` opens whatever HA state exists under
   `<dir>/ha/` (see the layout below). Nothing is created; a directory with no
   HA state is an error rather than an empty database.

Local handles and `--data-dir` always win over a remote default, so a
configured or environment-supplied admin URL can never turn a local-file
command into an HTTP call by surprise. Raw token flags (`--admin-token`,
`--token`, `--*-token-file`) are refused at parse time; tokens reach the CLI
only through the environment. The literal `--` before the verb, which older
scripts and the operator's generated command lines still emit, is accepted and
ignored.

### Identity

Every replication log and progress WAL records the identity it was written
under (cluster, shard, table, timeline, epoch). `--data-dir` and the local
config path read that identity back instead of requiring the five identity
flags: a standby's identity comes from the newest record in its progress WAL
(`standby.readPersistedIdentity`), a primary's from the newest replication
record (`primary.readPersistedIdentity`). Explicit identity flags override the
derived values field by field, which is what recovery procedures need when the
files disagree with the operator's intent. A fresh primary with no records has
no identity to read and must be given one, exactly as `antfly standalone`
requires on first start.

### Data directory layout

`antfly standby --data-dir` reads one layout under the data root, documented
in `DATA_DIR.md`. The directory and the file names follow the flags
(`--hot-standby-log` is `standby/log.wal`):

```text
<data-dir>/standby/
  primary.wal            primary replication log     (--hot-standby-primary-log)
  slots                  replication slot store      (--hot-standby-primary-slots)
  log.wal                standby receive log         (--hot-standby-log)
  progress.wal           standby durable progress    (--hot-standby-progress)
  fence.wal              promotion fence store       (--hot-standby-fence-wal)
```

Nodes created before 0.3 have `ha/{primary.wal,slots,standby.wal,
standby-progress.wal,fence.wal}`; `--data-dir` prefers the `standby/` tree and
falls back to an existing `ha/` tree, and never creates either.

#### Layout migration

The server moves an old tree itself, once, at startup
(`storage/hot_standby/layout.zig`, called before any hot-standby store is
opened). For every configured hot-standby path whose parent directory is
named `standby`: if that directory is absent and a sibling `ha/` exists, the
whole directory is renamed `ha/` -> `standby/` (one atomic rename, so the
operator's `seed-captures/` and `standby-generations/` move with it); then,
inside `standby/`, `standby.wal` becomes `log.wal` and `standby-progress.wal`
becomes `progress.wal` when the new name is absent. Nothing is deleted or
overwritten: if both spellings of a file exist the server keeps both and
warns, and if both `ha/` and `standby/` directories exist it leaves `ha/`
alone. A crash between the directory rename and the file renames is
harmless because the file step is per-file and idempotent, so the next start
finishes it. Paths whose parent is not named `standby` are never touched, so
custom layouts are unaffected. `antfly standby --data-dir` never migrates; it
only reads.

The Kubernetes operator drives the switch. It records the layout it renders
into pod arguments in `status.haStatus.dataLayout` (`ha` or `standby`) and
never moves it back. Because a status write can fail after the StatefulSet was
already updated, the rendered StatefulSet is the source of truth: the pod
template carries the annotation `antfly.io/hot-standby-data-layout`, written
in the same update as the arguments, and an undecided status is recovered
from that annotation (or from `/antflydb/standby/` in the rendered arguments)
before the operator would ever fall back to `ha`. A brand-new cluster gets
`standby` immediately, where brand-new means no StatefulSet AND no surviving
volume claim (a PVC named `<claim template>-<StatefulSet>-<ordinal>` carrying
the cluster's `app.kubernetes.io/instance` label): a StatefulSet can be deleted
and recreated while its volume, and the `ha/` tree on it, survive. An existing
cluster, or a surviving volume, stays on `ha` until the operator's admin
client has negotiated the canonical `/admin/v1/standby` path style with one of
its nodes, which proves the nodes run a server that has the migration; it then
flips the status, emits a `HotStandbyLayoutStandby` event, and the next pod
rollout carries the new paths, at which point each node migrates its own
volume on start. Explicit
`spec.highAvailability.runtime.*Path` overrides are rendered as given and are
never migrated by the operator. Server flags stay on the `--ha-*` spellings in
generated arguments until the operator's minimum server is 0.3, because every
supported server accepts those.

Role is inferred from which files exist: primary if `primary.wal` and `slots`
are present, standby if `log.wal` and `progress.wal` (or their legacy names)
are present, and a node that has been promoted in place may legitimately have
both. The
former-primary log used by `rejoin rewind` is not derived because it is the
primary log itself and opening it twice in one process would contend for the
same lock; `rewind` runs against a stopped node with an explicit
`--former-primary-log`.

### The `hot_standby` config section

`specs/openapi/antfly/config.yaml` defines `HotStandbyConfig`, mirrored
one-to-one onto the `antfly standalone --hot-standby-*` flags (the `--ha-*`
spellings remain aliases for one minor release). The section is named
`hot_standby:`; the deprecated `ha:` key is still read for one minor release:

```yaml
hot_standby:
  admin:     { url: http://127.0.0.1:8080, token_env: ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN }
  identity:  { cluster_id: 1, shard_id: 0, table_id: 0, timeline_id: 1, epoch: 1 }
  primary:   { log: /var/lib/antfly/standby/primary.wal, slots: /var/lib/antfly/standby/slots, node_id: primary-a }
  standby:   { log: /var/lib/antfly/standby/log.wal, progress: /var/lib/antfly/standby/progress.wal, node_id: standby-a, upstream_url: http://primary:8080, slot: standby-a }
  sync:      { mode: remote-write, selection: any, required: 1, standbys: [standby-a], failure: block }
  retention: { max_lag_lsn: 0, max_retained_bytes: 0, max_retained_age_ns: 0 }
  fence_wal: /var/lib/antfly/standby/fence.wal
  former_primary_log: /var/lib/antfly/standby/primary.wal
```

`antfly standalone --config` fills any hot-standby flag it was not given from this
section; a flag on the command line always wins, so the operator's generated
argument lists keep their exact meaning and the section removes repetition
rather than changing precedence. `admin.token_env` is the same variable the
server requires for bearer authentication and the CLI reads to authenticate, so
the token itself never appears in configuration. The startup-gate flags used by
seed activation (`--hot-standby-startup-*`) are deliberately not mirrored: they are
per-generation evidence the operator computes, not durable configuration.

### Fence generation allocation

`POST /admin/v1/standby/fence` no longer requires `generation`. When the field is omitted the
fence store allocates the next generation itself: the held receipt's generation
plus one, or 1 when no fence exists. Two rules keep this safe:

- **Idempotent retries.** A retried omitted-generation request whose other
  fields match the held receipt returns that receipt instead of minting a new
  fence. Without this, a lost response followed by a retry would double-fence,
  and a caller that also advanced timeline and epoch could double-promote.
- **Authority stays external where one exists.** Allocation is a node-local
  counter. Under a Kubernetes Lease authority the generation must remain the
  exact Lease transition, so the operator's plan-to-argv path still fails with
  `FenceGenerationMissing` when `fencing_authority` is `kubernetes_lease`, and
  the Lease watchdog still requires a positive `leaseTransitions`. Allocation
  exists for standalone and human-driven deployments that have no Lease.

Allocation happens inside `fencing.Store.acquirePromotionFence`, which already
runs under the fence barrier and the HA state mutex, so the read of the held
generation and the append of the new receipt are one critical section.

### `follow`: repointing a standby without a restart

A standby's upstream was fixed at process start; the puller read it immutably
every round and the only way to move a standby to a new primary was a pod
restart with new flags. `POST /admin/v1/standby/upstream` (`antfly standby follow
--upstream-url <url> --slot <name>`) replaces the upstream URL and slot a
running standby pulls from. The request carries the identity the caller expects
the standby to have; a mismatch is rejected with the existing `WrongTimeline`,
`WrongEpoch`, and sibling errors (409), so a stale operator cannot repoint a node
that has since been promoted or reseeded. A request that matches the current
upstream returns `changed: false`, which makes retries idempotent. The node
fails closed when it is not a configured standby or has already promoted. The
swap also fixed a latent race: the replication round used to copy the upstream
config before taking the state mutex and then use its slices across unlocked
network I/O; the read now happens under the lock and superseded strings are
retired only when no round can hold them.

### `switchover`: planned primary change

The operator's promotion chain is a failover chain: it is unreachable while the
primary is healthy. `antfly standby switchover --to <standby-admin-url>` is the
planned counterpart, composed entirely from existing typed routes plus
`follow`. It is zero-loss without a drain endpoint because it fences the old
primary first and only then reads the boundary:

1. **Preflight, no writes.** Read `status primary` on the target and `status
   standby` on `--to`. Refuse unless both report the same cluster, shard,
   table, timeline, and epoch, the standby is active and not reseed-required,
   and its lag is within `--max-lag-lsn`.
2. **Fence the old primary.** `POST /admin/v1/standby/fence` on the primary with
   `new_timeline_id = t+1`, `new_epoch = e+1`, `required_lsn = observed_lsn =
   current_lsn`, `promoted_node_id` = the standby's node id, and `generation`
   from `--generation` or allocated by the node. The primary's write gate fails
   closed on the matching receipt; no further writes can land.
3. **Wait for the boundary.** Re-read the fenced primary's final LSN and poll
   the standby until received, applied, and safe-read LSNs reach it (bounded by
   `--wait-timeout`). Writes that landed between preflight and the fence are
   shipped normally; nothing is lost because nothing can be written after the
   fence.
4. **Fence and promote the standby.** `POST /admin/v1/standby/fence` on the standby with the
   same fields and the same generation as the primary's receipt (so both nodes
   hold one fence), then `POST /admin/v1/standby/promotion/assess` with `required_lsn` set to
   the final LSN and `use_current_fence`, requiring mode `safe`, then
   `POST /admin/v1/standby/promotion/current-fence`.
5. **Assess the old primary's rejoin.** Read `fence/current` from the new
   primary and `POST /admin/v1/standby/rejoin/assess` on the old one with the receipt. A
   quiesced switchover forks exactly at the boundary, so the verdict is
   `rewind`. The rewind itself is not executed here: the old node still owns
   its replication log while it runs in the primary role, and a log cannot be
   opened twice in one process, so `POST /admin/v1/standby/rejoin/rewind` runs after the
   node restarts in the standby role with `former_primary_log` configured. The
   CLI reports the step as `rejoin-rewind-pending`. If the verdict is `reseed`,
   `POST /admin/v1/standby/rejoin/reseed` on the new primary marks the slot immediately.
6. **Follow.** Every URL given with `--follower` receives `POST
   /admin/v1/standby/upstream` pointing at `--new-upstream-url` (default `--to`),
   with the pre-switchover identity as the precondition.

Failure between steps 2 and 4 leaves the old primary fenced and read-only,
which is the safe side: the operator can retry the switchover once the standby
catches up, or promote with `force` knowingly. The CLI prints each step's
typed receipt so the sequence is auditable, and `--dry-run` stops after
preflight. Two limits remain and are listed under Open work: the demoted
primary keeps running in the primary role until it is restarted with
`ha.standby.*` configuration (the operator does this by rolling the pod), at
which point its pending rewind runs, and the Kubernetes operator does not yet
plan a switchover itself.

## Test Strategy

HA needs both black-box e2e coverage and deterministic simulation coverage. The
Python e2e suite should add a Zig-backed standby test, for example
`test_standby.py`, once the runtime and admin API are usable as real process
surfaces. That e2e test should not exist only to assert whitespace or argument
validation. It should launch real Antfly processes and cover the user-visible
Postgres-style flow:

1. start a primary;
2. create a replication slot and seed a standby from the primary;
3. start the standby against the seeded data and replication stream;
4. write data to the primary;
5. wait for standby catch-up and verify read-only standby visibility;
6. restart the standby and verify local received-WAL replay plus stream resume;
7. later, fence and promote the standby, then verify the old primary rejects
   writes or must rejoin through rewind/reseed.

The first version of `test_standby.py` should stop at the black-box async path
if promotion is not wired yet, but it should still be a real process test:
primary process, standby process, durable directories, admin API or CLI setup,
client writes, standby catch-up observation, standby restart, and read-only
verification. Whitespace or argument-validation coverage belongs in unit tests;
it is not enough evidence for HA.

Treat the e2e work as a set of concrete product-path gates:

- the initial gate proves primary startup, slot creation, base-backup seed,
  standby startup, primary writes, standby catch-up, read-only enforcement, and
  standby restart/replay using real processes and durable files;
- the admin-auth gate proves typed `/admin/v1/standby` calls require bearer auth when
  `--admin-token-env` is configured, while health checks and replication
  traffic remain separate from that control-plane auth;
- the freshness gate proves standby reads report stale, `at_least_lsn`, and
  primary-only routing decisions instead of serving ambiguous read-after-write
  behavior;
- the synchronous-commit gate proves `remote_write` and `remote_apply` decisions
  against real standby progress, including fail-closed behavior when no standby
  can satisfy the requested durability;
- the retention gate proves lagging or abandoned slots become
  `reseed_required` and do not pin WAL forever without an operator-visible
  status;
- the promotion gate proves a standby can be fenced, promoted, and made current
  only with machine-checkable receipt evidence, and that the old primary rejects
  writes once it has observed the fence;
- the former-primary gate proves an old primary cannot rejoin without a fence,
  can rewind only when the retained WAL/fork record is sufficient, and otherwise
  is explicitly marked for reseed.

The Zig simulation tests should carry most of the correctness burden because
they can explore interleavings that are expensive or flaky in process e2e. Add
model or harness coverage for:

- crash after WAL receive before apply;
- crash after apply before acknowledgement, including the window where the
  standby has durable applied progress but the primary has not received the
  status update yet;
- primary crash before and after synchronous acknowledgement;
- duplicate, missing, out-of-order, or divergent WAL records;
- delayed status updates and stale slot progress;
- promotion with a valid fence, without a fence, and with stale fence evidence;
- old-primary return after promotion;
- rewind versus reseed decisions;
- retention expiry forcing reseed;
- timeline switch propagation to remaining standbys.

The expected split is: e2e proves the supported CLI/admin/operator path works
with real processes and files, while Zig simulation proves the state machine is
correct under crash, restart, partition, and replay ordering stress. Production
readiness should depend on the simulation matrix because it can cover failure
windows, duplicate delivery, reordered delivery, and promotion races that would
be too slow or nondeterministic to rely on in process e2e alone.

## Failure Cases

### Primary crash, async standby behind

The standby may not have acknowledged writes. Promotion can proceed with data
loss only if the operator or failover policy accepts that RPO.

### Primary crash, remote-write standby current

The standby has durable WAL. Promotion should replay through the required LSN
before becoming writable.

### Standby crash

The standby recovers from local received WAL, reports its progress, and resumes
from its slot. If the primary has already discarded required WAL, the standby
must be reseeded.

### Network partition

This is where fencing matters. A standby must not self-promote just because it
cannot reach the primary. Some authority must decide which side may write.

### Former primary returns after promotion

The former primary must not accept writes. It must discover the newer timeline
and either rewind or reseed.

## Implementation

The subsystems below make up the shipped hot-standby implementation. They are
grouped by concern rather than by build sequence; cross-references replace the
old phase ordering where one component depends on another.

### Local Replication Format

`zig/pkg/antfly/src/storage/hot_standby/replication_record.zig` defines the
`ReplicationRecord` envelope and binary codec described in
[WAL Stream Shape](#wal-stream-shape). `compat.zig` hard-codes golden v1
byte fixtures so header, endian, enum, CRC, or payload layout drift is caught
before two Antfly versions fail to replicate. `vopr.zig` and `chaos.zig` run an
in-process primary/standby simulation that appends records and applies them to
a standby store, covering CRC, versioning, ordering, and corrupt-tail behavior.

### Snapshot Plus WAL Catch-Up

Base-backup checkpoint creation, manifest pinning, and copy/restore for local
LSM storage live in `backup_manifest.zig`, `seed_capture.zig`,
`seed_artifact.zig`, `seed_materialization.zig`, `seed_activation.zig`, and
`bootstrap.zig`. `received_lsn` and `applied_lsn` metadata (see
[Apply Semantics](#apply-semantics)) is tracked through standby restart and
catch-up from copied storage plus WAL, and exercised by the simulation and
chaos harnesses above.

### Streaming Transport

The internal replication API under `/internal/v1` (`specs/openapi/antfly/internal.yaml`)
provides `identifyHAReplicationSystem`, `createHAReplicationStreamingSlot`,
`startHAReplication`, and `updateHAStandbyStatus`, implemented by
`replication_api.zig`, `http_internal.zig`, and `http_replication_client.zig`.
This transport implements backpressure, batching, and the lag/status surfaces
described in [Replication Slots and Retention](#replication-slots-and-retention).

### Async Durability and Ack Plumbing

Async commit is the default durability mode. `slot_store.zig` and `status.zig`
track standby acknowledgements without gating primary commit, persisting
per-standby `received_lsn`, `applied_lsn`, and slot status, and surfacing
degraded, lagging, and reseed-needed status through `metrics.zig` and the
admin status endpoints.

### Promotion

Standby promotion, timeline switch records, forced-promotion guardrails, and
former-primary rejoin handling are implemented in `fencing.zig`,
`rejoin.zig`, `operator.zig`, and `lifecycle_receipt_ledger.zig`. Automatic
failover integrates with a concrete fencing mechanism (Kubernetes Lease via
`kubernetes_lease_watchdog.zig`, or another configured ownership authority);
see [Operator Integration](#operator-integration).

### Production Hardening

`chaos.zig` and `vopr.zig` cover crash during base backup, WAL receive, and
apply; crash after receive before apply; crash after apply before
acknowledgement (proving the primary does not treat `remote_apply` as
satisfied until the resumed standby reports durable applied progress); primary
crash before and after synchronous acknowledgement; duplicate, missing,
divergent, or out-of-order WAL records; network partition; promotion with and
without valid fence evidence; standby lag and reseed; retained WAL expiry
forcing reseed; former-primary return; and timeline switch propagation.
`metrics.zig` and the admin status surfaces expose operator-visible state, and
`compat.zig` provides compatibility tests across replication format versions.
The Python `zig/e2e/antfly/test_standby*.py` suites cover real primary/standby
process startup, seed, catch-up, standby restart, and read-only standby
verification, alongside the Zig simulation coverage for the HA state machine.

### Synchronous Failover

`commit_gate.zig` and `write_gate.zig` implement the `remote_write` and
`remote_apply` commit modes on top of the async replication path, including
`ANY`, `FIRST`, and `ALL` synchronous standby policies and `block`,
`fail_closed`, and `degrade_to_async` failure policies (see
[Durability Modes](#durability-modes)). Fenced automatic promotion uses a
concrete ownership authority, described in [Operator Integration](#operator-integration).

### CLI and Admin API

`/admin/v1/standby` is the stable typed control-plane API, defined in the dedicated
`specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml` OpenAPI spec, separate from the public DB
and `/internal/v1` specs. Generated Zig admin request/response types, request
parsing helpers, and shared route/type constants live in
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/` (`mod.zig`, `routes.zig`). `admin.yaml` and
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/` are the only source locations for the HA admin
HTTP contract; public DB specs and `/internal/v1` specs reference HA concepts
only as clients of the contract, never as owners of HA operator actions.

Node-local admin behavior in the HA runtime (`admin.zig`, `admin_exec.zig`,
`http_admin.zig`) imports `zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/` types and routes rather
than hard-coding `/admin/v1/standby` paths or schemas in storage modules. The admin
API covers: creating, dropping, pausing, resuming, and listing replication
slots; seeding a standby from a base backup with resumable action state;
reporting primary LSN, standby received/apply LSN, lag, slot retention,
degraded sync status, and reseed recommendations; promotion with explicit
safe, forced, and lossy modes; timeline/LSN compatibility checks before
promotion or rejoin; and former-primary rewind-or-reseed workflows.

The CLI (`admin_cli.zig`) is a thin client over `/admin/v1/standby` for remote
operations, with local/offline helpers only where direct filesystem access is
required; CLI table and JSON output are aligned with the admin API response
schemas.

The supported Zig `antfly standalone` runtime starts a primary with a durable
HA replication log, slot store, promotion fence WAL, optional former-primary
rewind log, optional admin bearer-token env var, node id, and identity flags,
attaching the same `/admin/v1/standby` executor, durable fence store,
former-primary log handle, admin auth enforcement, and
`/internal/v1/standby/replication` executor used by tests and the CLI. A standby
can likewise be started with a durable received-WAL log, progress WAL,
promotion fence WAL, optional former-primary rewind log, admin bearer-token
env var, node id, and identity flags; its runtime path exposes `/admin/v1/standby`
status, read/write gate, bootstrap, and promotion operations against the real
standby handle, guarded by the same admin auth policy as primary nodes.
Continuous pull/apply plugs into the DataServer-managed standby DB open path
so applied LSN only advances after replicated records are applied to storage.
Every provisioned writer DB opened by that DataServer path carries the same HA
write gate (`write_gate.zig`, `read_gate.zig`) as the node's admin role, so
standby processes reject client/local-owner writes and suppress
primary-only background mutation loops while still permitting replicated
apply.

The Go admin client/types are generated from `specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml`
into `go/pkg/sdk/admin/oapi`, wrapped by `go/pkg/sdk/admin` (`ha.go`) following
the style of the other SDK APIs; this is the single Go generation target for
the admin contract. The wrapper validates slot names, node ids, and other
durable HA identifiers before constructing operation metadata or issuing
generated requests — path escaping alone is not treated as validation.
`go/pkg/operator` consumes the `go/pkg/sdk/admin` wrapper for remote admin
operations rather than importing generated `oapi` internals or maintaining a
second set of method paths, request/response structs, retry classification,
or auth header plumbing. The supported Zig CLI consumes
`zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/` bindings and route constants from the same
contract; CLI-only code paths are limited to local filesystem recovery,
pod-local volume manipulation, or explicit break-glass workflows.

### Operator Integration

The Kubernetes operator integration lives in `go/pkg/operator`. The Zig HA
planner is a portable policy engine; CRD fields, status conditions,
admin-job targeting, service updates, and promotion automation live in the
operator package and are covered by its controller test suite
(`controllers/antfly/ha_*.go`).

The `AntflyCluster` CRD (`api/antfly/v1/antflycluster_types.go`) defines
`HighAvailabilitySpec` with HA mode, standby topology (`HAStandbySpec`), sync
policy (`HASyncPolicy`), failure policy (`HAFailurePolicy`), retention caps,
durable runtime WAL/fence paths (`HARuntimeSpec`), and automatic-failover
policy (`HAAutomaticFailoverPolicy`), plus a matching `HAStatus` status block.
The operator bootstraps standby pods from base backup and attaches them to
replication slots, manages slot lifecycle and WAL retention pressure, and
prefers typed `/admin/v1/standby` calls for idempotent operator actions.
`specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml` plus `zig/pkg/antfly/src/admin/` are the
operator-facing contract source for admin HTTP method/path, request, and
response fields; the Go admin client/types generated into
`go/pkg/sdk/admin/oapi` and wrapped in `go/pkg/sdk/admin` are what the
operator imports for executable `/admin/v1/standby` calls. The operator keeps path
constants only for status display and plan summaries — live calls, auth
header installation, retry/error classification, and request/response
decoding go through the SDK wrapper.

Authenticated admin endpoints work by having the operator read a bearer token
from a configured process environment variable, defaulting to
`ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN`, injected into the operator pod from a Secret without
requiring broad direct Secret read permissions. Runtime-side admin auth is
passed via `--admin-token-env` from
`spec.highAvailability.runtime.adminTokenEnvVar`; Antfly pods receive the same
token through `spec.standalone.envFrom` or the explicit
`spec.highAvailability.runtime.adminTokenSecretRef` secret-key injection.
Admission rejects `adminTokenSecretRef.optional=true`, and the process fails
closed if the configured env var is missing or empty.
`spec.highAvailability.runtime` is scoped to operator Standalone mode until
the split metadata/data topology has first-class HA process wiring; admission
rejects runtime fields outside Standalone mode.

Each executable planned action is published with its typed admin HTTP
method/path and target admin URL, with CLI argv kept only as a compatibility
and break-glass execution hint. Former-primary rewind targets the former
primary's admin URL, not the current primary; reseed scheduling/slot marking
targets the current primary, then runs any data-replacement step through a
pod-local helper on the node being reseeded. The
`highAvailability.runtime.formerPrimaryLogPath` operator field is passed to
`antfly standalone --hot-standby-former-primary-log` on nodes that may need
rewind/rejoin — for the original primary this is usually the same durable
file as `highAvailability.runtime.primary.logPath`; after failover it becomes
the former primary's local evidence for timeline divergence checks and
rewind decisions. CLI-backed Kubernetes Jobs are used only for workflows that
need pod-local mounted files, shared backup volumes, or explicit break-glass
execution.

The operator publishes lag, degraded, unhealthy, and reseed-required
conditions, and coordinates fenced failover through Kubernetes Lease, storage
fencing, or another configured ownership authority
(`ha_physical_fence.go`, `kubernetes_lease_watchdog.zig`). When Kubernetes
Lease fencing is used, the Lease is scoped to the exact HA identity and
promotion boundary it protects: the operator writes and validates
machine-readable Lease annotations for `cluster_id`, `shard_id`, `table_id`,
current primary id, timeline, epoch, and primary LSN before treating the
Lease as a ready fence, and a stale Lease from an older timeline, epoch,
primary, or observed LSN blocks automatic promotion even if its holder and
renewal timestamp are otherwise valid. The operator updates Services, routes,
and client-facing primary endpoints after promotion, and automates
former-primary demotion, rewind, or reseed after failover. Automatic
promotion stays disabled unless the [Synchronous Failover](#synchronous-failover)
fencing requirements are satisfied by the configured environment.

## Operator Runbooks

Hot-standby HA ships with boring operator runbooks, maintained as
`go/pkg/operator/docs/operations/hot-standby-ha.md`. The summary below is a
pointer into that runbook, which covers the Kubernetes operator path in
`go/pkg/operator`, the typed `/admin/v1/standby` path generated from
`specs/openapi/antfly/admin.yaml`, and the supported Zig CLI path. The split
is explicit:

- typed `/admin/v1/standby` calls are the preferred operator and SDK automation
  surface;
- CLI commands are human and break-glass helpers, or pod-local helpers for
  workflows that need mounted data paths;
- `/internal/v1` remains runtime-to-runtime replication plumbing, not an
  operator control surface.

The runbook prerequisites should require `HotStandby` mode, an explicit HA
identity (`clusterID`, timeline, epoch, and current primary), standby topology,
admin URLs, durable runtime paths, and matching admin bearer-token environment
injection for the operator and Antfly pods. Automatic failover additionally
requires `executePlannedActions`, a supported fencing authority, route selectors
for the primary endpoint, and admin URLs for the primary, standbys, and any
former-primary repair target.

Daily checks should teach operators to inspect `status.haStatus` and the HA
conditions, especially `HAAvailable`, `HADegraded`, `HAUnhealthy`, `HALagging`,
`HARetentionPressure`, `HAReseedRequired`, and
`HAAutomaticFailoverReady`. The minimum status fields to check are primary
admin reachability, primary LSN, standby received/applied/safe-read LSNs,
retention pressure, sync-policy satisfaction, primary route state, former
primary state, and `plannedActions`.

Bootstrap and reseed runbooks should follow the typed planned actions instead
of ad hoc shelling out. A standby seed should be visible as actions such as
slot creation, seed scheduling, seed bootstrap, and seed completion. A reseed
should be explicit when retained WAL is no longer sufficient. Operators should
verify the action target, admin method/path, admin URL, admin node id, action
receipt, backup manifest, checkpoint, and safe-read progress before marking a
standby healthy. A lagging standby must not pin WAL forever without either a
catch-up path or an operator-visible reseed decision.

Promotion runbooks should require a machine-checkable fence before automatic
promotion. With Kubernetes Lease fencing, the Lease must be scoped to the exact
cluster, shard/table identity, current primary, timeline, epoch, and observed
primary LSN. A stale Lease from an older identity, timeline, epoch, primary, or
LSN blocks automatic promotion. The operator should record planned actions for
fence acquisition, promotion assessment, standby promotion, primary-route
update, and former-primary demotion, rewind, or reseed. Forced promotion should
produce a distinct lossy receipt and should never look identical to a safe
promotion.

Former-primary runbooks should be first-class. A returning old primary cannot
resume writes merely because it restarted. It must observe the newer timeline
and either demote, rewind using retained WAL and fork evidence, or reseed from
the current primary. Rewind targets the former primary's admin URL because it
uses that node's local state. Reseed scheduling targets the current primary for
slot/seed coordination and uses a pod-local helper only for the data replacement
step on the former primary. The status and receipt must prove which node was
acted on and whether rewind or reseed was required.

Alert guidance should cover admin 401/403 responses, missing or unreachable
admin URLs, missing typed result evidence, unhealthy or lagging standbys,
retention pressure, reseed requirements, degraded synchronous commit, stale
fences, unsafe promotion requests, and old-primary write attempts after
promotion. The useful evidence is not just log text: preserve `plannedActions`,
typed admin receipts, fence token/generation, timeline/epoch/LSN boundaries,
admin action ids, target node ids, and route-update status so an operator can
explain exactly why the system promoted, refused to promote, rewound, or
required a reseed.

## Production Readiness

Hot standby is not called production grade merely because records can stream
from one process to another. The production bar is that ordinary and adverse
operational workflows are typed, observable, restartable, and fenced, and that
bar is met: real `antfly standalone` primary and standby runtime wiring
(durable replication logs, received-WAL logs, slot stores, progress WALs,
fence WALs, former-primary logs, read/write gates, admin auth, and
background-job gating); the stable `/admin/v1/standby` OpenAPI contract generated
into Zig admin bindings and the Go SDK admin wrapper, consumed by the
Kubernetes operator instead of shelling out or duplicating HTTP code;
base-backup creation, manifest pinning, file/object copy, checksum
validation, catch-up, and resumable seed workflows; asynchronous replication
with explicit received/apply progress and durable slots; synchronous commit
policies matching the intended Postgres semantics (`remote_write`,
`remote_apply`, `ANY`, `FIRST`, `ALL`, and `block`, `fail_closed`, or
`degrade_to_async` failure behavior); promotion with durable timeline switch
records, machine-checkable fence receipts, forced-promotion receipts, and
old-primary write rejection; `pg_rewind`-style former-primary repair where
retained WAL is sufficient, plus explicit reseed when rewind is unsafe or
retention has expired; standby read routing and freshness controls (stale
reads, `at_least_lsn`, primary-only read-after-write routing); WAL retention
pressure handling, slot expiration, and reseed-required status; versioned
replication record compatibility tests; metrics, logs, audit events, status
conditions, action receipts, and runbooks; and crash, partition, and replay
simulation coverage plus real-process e2e coverage. See
[Implementation](#implementation) for where each of these lives in the
codebase.

The minimum production-grade target is a boring single-primary system: the
primary streams ordered records, standbys recover and apply deterministically,
promotion requires a fence and creates a new timeline, the former primary
cannot silently continue, and the operator can explain every action it took.
That target has shipped. Extensions beyond it — deeper cross-version
compatibility guarantees, WAL archive/PITR, cascading or relay replication,
cross-region latency policy, and further read-replica routing or operator
ergonomics work — are tracked in [Open work](#open-work).

## Recommendation

Hot standby is Antfly's simple, efficient HA/read-replica/DR path, alongside
Raft as the consensus-backed path for distributed write ownership:

- Hot standby: single-primary availability with configurable RPO/RTO, async
  or synchronous standby durability, and fenced promotion (manual or
  automatic depending on configuration).
- Raft: multi-node consensus and automatic quorum-protected write ownership.

The shipped scope covers a single primary, async and synchronous standbys,
base backup plus WAL catch-up, read-only standbys, and both manual and fenced
automatic promotion with timeline switch. Further hardening and feature work
is tracked in [Open work](#open-work) rather than blocking the existing
production surface.

## Open work

The items below are genuinely not implemented, or are explicitly out of scope
for the current hot-standby design, as distinct from the shipped subsystems
described in [Implementation](#implementation):

- **WAL archive / point-in-time recovery**: no archive or PITR-style recovery
  path exists alongside streaming replication and base backup.
- **Cascading or relay replicas**: standbys replicate only from the primary;
  there is no standby-of-standby relay topology.
- **Cross-region latency policy**: synchronous commit policy supports `ANY`,
  `FIRST`, and `ALL` standby sets, but there is no latency- or
  region-aware policy layer on top of it.
- **Richer read-replica routing**: read routing supports `stale_ok`,
  `at_least_lsn`, and `primary` (see [Read Behavior](#read-behavior)); there is
  no geo- or latency-aware routing beyond these three modes.
- **Shard-granular / split metadata-data HA**: the shipped mode replicates a
  whole standalone instance or explicit shard set with one primary metadata
  owner (see [Metadata and Shards](#metadata-and-shards)).
  `spec.highAvailability.runtime` is intentionally scoped to operator
  Standalone mode until the split metadata/data topology has first-class HA
  process wiring; shard-granular promotion would reintroduce distributed
  ownership and routing complexity and may need a small metadata consensus
  layer even with WAL-based data replication.
- **Operator ergonomics polish**: the common-case workflows are covered by
  `go/pkg/operator/docs/operations/hot-standby-ha.md`, but further work to
  make edge cases boring (for example, richer degraded-state guidance) can
  continue without changing the core contract.
- **Operator flag spellings**: the operator still generates the `--ha-*`
  server flags (aliases every supported server accepts). Switch to
  `--hot-standby-*` once the operator's minimum server is 0.3; the data layout
  already switches per cluster via `status.haStatus.dataLayout`.
- **Operator-planned switchover**: `antfly standby switchover` composes the planned
  sequence from typed routes, but the Kubernetes operator still plans only
  failover; a `spec`-driven planned switchover that reuses the same steps and
  the new `standby/upstream` route is the next automation step.
- **Role change without restart**: a demoted primary stays in the primary
  role, still owning its replication log, until it restarts with
  `ha.standby.*` configuration; only then can its rewind run. A runtime role
  switch would need the promotion handoff machinery to run in reverse and a
  way to hand the log from the primary owner to the rewind path.
- **Drain endpoint**: the switchover relies on fencing to stop writes and then
  reads the final LSN. An explicit "stop accepting writes and report the final
  LSN" call would let the CLI report the boundary before fencing; it is not
  required for correctness.

### Catalog-create retries

In whole-instance mode, a table-create retry waits for RemoteApply through the
current primary log position before returning `table already exists`. A table
visible only on the primary still returns the versioned unknown-outcome response,
including after primary restart. Catch-up lets the same retry complete without
appending another catalog record or restarting the primary.

### Operator catalog-mode opt-in

For operator-managed whole-instance catalog replication, set the AntflyCluster
annotation `antfly.io/ha-catalog-replication: "true"` on both nodes and use zero
table/shard identities with the matching runtime and operator release. The
operator then emits explicit zero CLI identities. Without this opt-in, omitted
or zero-valued identity fields retain the legacy omitted CLI arguments; existing
nonzero table-scoped identities remain unchanged across operator upgrades.
