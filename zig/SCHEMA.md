# Schema

This repo now has a real split between:

- Public schema contract: JSON Schema plus Antfly extensions and dynamic templates
- Versioned runtime schema: compiled execution metadata used by indexing, reopen, and query-time helpers

## Public Contract

The table schema surface is Go-compatible by design.

Document-schema fields may use:

- `x-antfly-types`
- `x-antfly-analyzer`
- `x-antfly-index`
- `x-antfly-include-in-all`
- `patternProperties`
- `additionalProperties`

Table-level dynamic templates may use:

- `match`
- `unmatch`
- `path_match`
- `path_unmatch`
- `match_mapping_type`
- `mapping.type`
- `mapping.analyzer`
- `mapping.index`
- `mapping.store`
- `mapping.include_in_all`
- `mapping.sortable`

## Runtime Model

The runtime schema is the source of truth for execution.

It is versioned and persisted in [go/pkg/antfly/src/storage/schema.zig](pkg/antfly/src/storage/schema.zig).
Compilation lives in [go/pkg/antfly/src/schema/mod.zig](pkg/antfly/src/schema/mod.zig).

The compiled model currently carries:

- explicit full-text fields
- compiled dynamic rules for `patternProperties`
- compiled dynamic rules for `additionalProperties` schema objects
- open dynamic text subtrees for `additionalProperties: true`
- open dynamic infer-types subtrees for object-scoped
  `x-antfly-dynamic-indexing.mode = "infer_types"`
- resolved dynamic-template selectors and mapping options

When no schema is present, Zig now follows a separate permissive path that is
meant to behave like Go/Bleve dynamic inference by default:

- nested string fields are indexed recursively for full-text search
- nested numeric, boolean, datetime, and geopoint fields are inferred
  recursively for typed queries
- nested objects and arrays are traversed instead of being limited to
  top-level fields

When a schema is present, the compiled runtime schema remains the source of
truth and the explicit `additionalProperties` policy below applies.

## TTL Semantics

TTL is intentionally close to Go, but not identical today.

Shared behavior:

- the runtime schema carries `ttl_duration_ns` and `ttl_field`
- query-time visibility filtering uses stored write-time metadata
- background TTL cleanup deletes expired documents by stored timestamp

Current Zig difference from Go:

- Go's schema contract treats the configured TTL field as required when TTL is enabled
- Go's schema-level TTL parsing expects string timestamps in RFC3339 or RFC3339Nano
- Zig is currently more permissive
  - if the configured `ttl_field` is missing from a write, Zig falls back to the batch/write timestamp
  - Zig accepts integer nanoseconds and numeric strings in addition to RFC3339 strings

This means Zig currently favors operational robustness over strict schema
enforcement for TTL-bearing writes. That is a deliberate documented difference
for now, not an accident.

With a schema present, `additionalProperties` has an explicit policy split:

- `additionalProperties: true` means open text fallback for unknown string fields only
- `additionalProperties: { ...schema... }` means explicit typed dynamic behavior compiled into runtime rules
- `additionalProperties: true` plus
  `x-antfly-dynamic-indexing: { "mode": "infer_types" }` means open dynamic
  inference for unknown nested fields under that object, including text,
  numeric, boolean, datetime, and geopoint detection

## Full-Text Rules

Explicit schema fields can expand into multiple emitted fields.

- primary `text` / `html` keeps the original field name
- `x-antfly-analyzer` applies to that primary explicit field
- `keyword` / `link` variant becomes `field__keyword` when a primary text field exists
- `search_as_you_type` variant becomes `field__2gram`
- `search_as_you_type + keyword` without a primary type auto-adds text semantics
- only the primary field participates in `_all`
- generated `__keyword` and `__2gram` variants keep their fixed analyzers

Dynamic templates do not use schema-style field expansion.
They are single mappings, matching Go's Bleve-template behavior.

That means:

- explicit fields and schema-driven dynamic rules can emit `__keyword` / `__2gram`
- dynamic templates emit a single field at the original path

## Link Fields

A field marked with the `link` type is not just indexed as a keyword; at
enrichment time its value is treated as a URL to fetch and process before the
result is used downstream. HTML content is run through readability-style
article extraction, PDF content is extracted to text, and image content is
converted for use as image data.

Fetching a link field's URL goes through the same security defaults as other
remote content fetches: private and loopback IP ranges are blocked by default,
so a link field cannot be used to reach internal services, and a single
download is capped at 100 MB so one link field cannot exhaust the fetch
budget.

## Resolution Order

Text indexing currently resolves dynamic fields in this order:

1. explicit compiled field plan
2. compiled dynamic rule from `patternProperties` / `additionalProperties` schema objects
3. dynamic template match
4. schema-present `infer_types` fallback for opted-in open dynamic objects
5. open `additionalProperties: true` text fallback

This ordering is enforced in [go/pkg/antfly/src/storage/db/document_mapper.zig](pkg/antfly/src/storage/db/document_mapper.zig).

Query-time analyzer resolution now uses the same compiled runtime schema for
explicit fields and compiled dynamic rules when a `match` or `match_phrase`
query does not specify an analyzer explicitly.

For dynamic-template fields, especially templates gated by
`match_mapping_type`, the text index now persists observed field-to-analyzer
bindings at index time and reloads them on reopen. That gives query-time
`match` / `match_phrase` exact analyzer inference for stable dynamic field
paths instead of falling back to field-name-only schema heuristics.

The first debug surface for this compiled plan now hangs off the existing admin
table and index detail routes via `?debug=runtime_schema`.

## Dynamic Templates and the Algebraic Index

Dynamic templates feed the algebraic sidecar as well as the full-text index, so
a template-matched field is promoted into typed group/measure/time docfacts at
ingest time — Elasticsearch-style runtime-adaptive mapping — without a schema
table recreate. Accepted template changes advance the schema generation; new
writes use the refreshed projection immediately while existing rows remain
gated until a sidecar rebuild proves complete coverage.

- `schema/mod.zig` compilation lowers each bounded template
  (`keyword`/`link`/`numeric`/`boolean`/`datetime`) into a capability
  `dynamic_field_rule`. A rule requires a name/path selector (`match` /
  `path_match`). Unbounded templates (`text`/`html`/`search_as_you_type`),
  selector-less templates, and `match_mapping_type`-only templates are
  intentionally NOT promoted — they stay on the schemaless path-fact path. This
  is the cardinality guard that keeps a broad `match: "*"` template from
  exploding group-by cardinality, and it keeps ingest and query symmetric: a
  `match_mapping_type`-only rule could be evaluated at ingest (a value is
  present) but never at query time (no value), so it is excluded from both.
  `index.zig:validateConfig` enforces the same selector requirement so a
  hand-authored config cannot reintroduce the asymmetry.
- At ingest, `storage/db/algebraic/index.zig` evaluates the rules against every
  observed field not already covered by a static spec. Name/path matching is
  shared with query resolution, while ingest additionally evaluates
  `match_mapping_type` through the canonical inference in `storage/schema.zig`.
  Explicit schema fields always win over templates. The FIRST
  selector-matching rule wins (Elasticsearch dynamic-template order): a value that
  does not coerce under that rule's type simply yields no fact (exactly like a
  static typed field given a non-coercible value) — ingest does not fall through
  to a later overlapping rule of a different type.
- The dynamic fact identity is the full dotted path (top-level templates have
  path == field name). Numeric templates project group+measure, datetime
  project group+time, keyword/boolean project group.
- At query time the planner resolves a queried field against the same
  `dynamic_field_rules` (`Index.fieldConfig`/`resolveField`), so group-by, sum,
  and term aggregations over template-promoted fields route to the sidecar's
  docfact fold scan. Resolution requires that all name/path-matching rules AGREE
  on the scalar type: with one matching rule (or several that agree) query reads
  the exact type ingest stored; if overlapping rules disagree, the field is
  ambiguous and query declines (the aggregation falls back to a complete scan)
  rather than reading a type that ingest may have stored differently per
  document. A name/path candidate that also has `match_mapping_type` is likewise
  declined because its applicability cannot be proven without a document value;
  this prevents a later fallback rule from being selected for mixed typed facts.

Template-only updates propagate without a recreate on two levels:

- the durable table `indexes_json` is regenerated on every schema update
  (`api/tables.zig: regenerateAlgebraicIndexesFromSchemaAlloc`), which carries
  forward user-tunable runtime knobs (adaptive policy, planner/result limits) so
  a schema change does not reset tuning; fresh opens, new replicas, and restarts
  pick up the new rules; and
- live indexes are refreshed in place
  (`DB.reloadAlgebraicSchemaConfigs` → `Index.reloadConfigJson`) so running
  writers apply the new rules immediately.

Because the change applies without re-projecting existing documents, structural
comparison of the old and new capabilities sets `dynamic_rules_backfill_pending`
for dynamic-rule changes — including legacy configs without a fingerprint.
While pending, query-time resolution of dynamic-template fields is withheld, so
aggregations over those fields fall back to a complete scan and return correct
results rather than aggregates computed over only the post-change subset.
Unchanged static fields keep accelerating. Static field type/layout changes use
the broader `capability_lifecycle_status = rebuild_required` gate so old docfacts
cannot be decoded under a new static config.

The durable flags remain conservative. After final replay converges under the
apply fence, a completed shadow rebuild writes a config-hash completion marker
inside that physical algebraic generation. The marker grants the active runtime
a readiness override before service resumes, and restart restores the override
only from the active generation's matching marker. Ordinary foreground apply
never writes it, and a later config reload resets the proof. This makes rebuild
completion authoritative without clearing metadata safety flags before the
rebuilt generation commits.
