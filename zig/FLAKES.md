# Zig runtime flakes

## 2026-10-01: full CI discovery drift and virtual HTTP teardown

[Run 36903575966](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36903575966)
failed physical storage compilation discovery after a fourth owner fixture was
added. The bounded audit now names its three measured owner fixtures and four
consumer fixtures explicitly. Missing and duplicate identities still fail;
unrelated owner fixtures remain covered by their normal targets. Real build
graph regressions prove that an unrelated, deliberately uncompilable owner
fixture is excluded and that omitting either a required owner or consumer fails.
The storage shard manifest also now imports `hot_standby/primary_effect.zig`
and the Lite allocator/reclamation test sources added on main.

The cancelled Zig job had already reported two deterministic API fixture
failures. The authority fixture now exercises a partially configured dedicated
authority, since absent dedicated fields intentionally inherit valid trusted
principal credentials. The rewrite fixture supplies its mandatory generation
handoff proof, including a nonzero owner retirement digest, while preserving
the atomic admission, idempotency, and unchanged live-schema assertions.

The same job timed out with a data-runtime test process still alive. Local
Debug reproduction retained the active UNIQUE/FK three-owner history and a
stack blocked in `Client.drainShutdown` during deferred `DataServer.deinit`.
Admitted HTTP requests still needed virtual tasks to unwind, but teardown had
stopped driving the scheduler. Composite shutdown now closes outbound read
admission with the other owners. The history publishes every initialized
node's stop, runs bounded scheduler cancellation/drain, checks that read-client
leases are gone, and only then reclaims node state. This also runs on failure
paths so a scenario failure can be reported instead of hidden by cleanup.

Once teardown could report failures, local Debug execution also exposed a
replicated merge stack overflow. A hardware watchpoint caught LSM open
scratch writes overwriting a parked driver's context. The managed DB opener
now selects `OpenOptions` before a single `DB.open`, instead of allocating a
large DB-valued return slot for each policy branch. The original 8 MiB VOPR
stack is retained, and the isolated merge regression passes.

The embedded provisioned point-read path did not advertise authoritative
read-index absence and still allowed a leader-loss stale fallback. The hosted
UNIQUE/FK coordinator therefore exhausted placements on an uncertified 404
following split cutover. Both physical and orchestration sources now expose
the strict capability, admission preserves quorum failures, and direct
`read_index` lookups cannot downgrade to stale. The history retains one physical
ownership path and passes its merge/split/restart and constraint assertions.
Apply-control shutdown also publishes its stop and wake separately from joining,
so a borrowed scheduler can complete its uncancellable wait before reclamation.

The store-report retry fixture now injects registration failures through the
registration transport, rather than an unused snapshot-fetch seam. Its runner
waits for the round's own completion and preserves unrelated runtime tasks
between rounds. The focused retry regression passes.

The full E2E binary build completed all 35 compilation steps at its 90-minute
deadline and was cancelled before upload. Narrow ReleaseSafe CPU reservations
now admit storage and inference concurrently under the existing 22 GiB budget,
with margins above that run's rounded compiler MaxRSS. See
[COMPILATION.md](COMPILATION.md#runtime-compilation-memory-reservations).
These measurements identify admission serialization; they do not yet establish
the fixed build's CI wall time.

Validation: the full data-runtime target passed 53 implementation and 177
consumer tests; the two reported API fixtures passed; all 461 hot-standby tests
and the storage ownership audit passed; 19 build-discovery/shard tests and both
memory-admission tests passed. The reproduced merge stack regression passed
200/200 fresh-process repetitions using `scripts/ci/zig_vopr_soak.py`'s bounded
process runner. The UNIQUE/FK merge/split/restart history also completed 200
passing repetitions; one interrupted process-runner invocation was rerun before
continuing the loop. Both soaks used the pre-merge revision; the full data-runtime
target also passed after merging main. The mocked compilation rollover test now fixes its disk-free
observation so a nearly full developer disk cannot alter its expected build
sequence.

## 2026-09-29: metadata WAL barriers and uncertain promotion outcomes (#919)

[Issue #919](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/919) records an Autograph
duplicate and two recovery failures in run 36609343247. Metadata logs include
a 12,339 ms physical WAL commit for 41 encoded bytes. This is not evidence of
a large batch or a second sync hidden inside that append. Local unchanged-main
reproduction passed four invocations of each reported selector; it did not
reproduce the CI disk latency.

Metadata Ready persistence now owns a bounded immutable WAL record
on an I/O worker. The Raft thread publishes its MemoryStorage delta and releases
dependent messages only after the barrier completes. Same-term heartbeats may
continue using the already durable term; votes, append acknowledgements and
new-term messages remain fenced. Heartbeat extraction compacts its queue once
in linear time, retaining skipped messages in order instead of repeatedly
shifting the queue. Completion wakes the existing progress driver
immediately. Failure is sticky, retirement joins the operation, and shutdown
cannot checkpoint over an unreconciled durable tail. Incoming snapshots persist
their payload before the WAL record on the same worker. Idle maintenance
serializes checkpoints, log truncation, applied watermarks and superseded
payload cleanup with Ready persistence. Local snapshot compaction retains its
immutable builder payload until asynchronous publication completes; only then
do storage and Raft expose the new compaction boundary. Application progress
that advances during a checkpoint is retained in memory and carried by later
maintenance. Deferred work is admitted before another Ready, with the same byte
ceilings and fenced oversized-task recovery. Established durable-prefix reads
and same-term heartbeats continue while maintenance I/O is outstanding.
Completed appends waiting for downstream admission also retain heartbeat
progress. Election ticks pause while the node's current term/vote is still
behind its durability barrier; an election cannot repeatedly invalidate its
unsent vote request during a slow write. Inbound traffic continues, and an
established leader retains its heartbeat and quorum clocks. Snapshot completion
rechecks both apply tasks and payload bytes before publication; another group's
backlog cannot bypass admission. Snapshot worker startup failures retain the
existing bounded publication retry backoff. Pending task/byte/oldest-age gauges expose
queue pressure. A lock-free oldest-barrier timestamp preserves the existing
progress-stall readiness deadline: short Raft rounds cannot hide a stalled
asynchronous WAL write. Completion/retirement clears the age; elapsed time
alone does not cancel the durable owner or mark its write failed.

Commit-only HardState updates no longer append or sync when term/vote and the
referenced entries are already durable. Later records fold in the cursor;
recovery admits only the committed prefix proved by durable application
completion or a snapshot. This removes redundant physical commits rather than
weakening entry, term/vote, configuration or snapshot durability.

The focused regressions hold a WAL operation for 123 virtual ticks, assert
heartbeat progress without early append acknowledgement/application, exercise
queue rejection and fenced recovery, and verify crash recovery after a skipped
commit-only sync. The real WAL regression also joins an outstanding append
before retirement and reopens the durable entries. Additional regressions hold
an election's vote write across 123 ticks, keep durable-prefix reads live during
checkpoint/snapshot publication, and reject a completed incoming snapshot when
either apply-task or byte admission has become unavailable.

Promotion keeps one immutable admitted batch in its existing companion state
row until both remote success and the local receipt are known. A retry recovers
that batch before diffing a newer resolution artifact, so a lost reply cannot
forget an earlier provisional key. A review-band decision retains its prior
accepted receipt while the mention exists. Deterministic tests cover both gaps;
the CI logs do not prove which of them caused the reported duplicate.

This change prevents ordinary WAL I/O from blocking Raft control progress and
removes redundant syncs. It does not establish faster underlying filesystem
sync latency. Graceful shutdown still joins outstanding I/O and performs its
final durability flush; it is intentionally not a fire-and-forget operation.
Stage timings distinguish snapshot publication, WAL append, truncation and
applied-watermark persistence when a worker exceeds 500 ms.

A preliminary soak reproduced a post-publication GET timeout after the schema
rewrite job succeeded. This differs from the original issue’s job-progress
timeout. The test retains the exact frontend, table/key, job result and metadata
snapshots on a transport failure; the data ReadIndex gate reports whether it
was still awaiting quorum or local application. Qualification remains pending
until that failure is diagnosed and the final source passes its clean soak.

Merged-main recovery smoke testing also exposed three deterministic integration
failures. Initial FK publication now removes a changed table's legacy listing
entry in the same transaction that installs its system-catalog binding, so the
authoritative binding and derived listing cannot disagree. A hidden initial-FK
placement with an absent private descriptor remains unadmitted and retries
through the existing bounded control backoff; it no longer terminates an
otherwise serving data process. Malformed generation authority remains fatal.
Finally, authenticated live rewrite source-copy artifacts remain logical
decoders: export excludes physical accepted-generation keys, and plan validation
uses their fenced pin/certificate proof rather than repository-cohort admission
proofs. Ordinary portable backups still require those admission proofs.

Live rewrites also carry the namespace-bound accepted-generation and retirement
summary for every source owner, including owners with empty summaries. Source
fencing seals that immutable authority; hidden targets install only mappings for
surviving FK declarations under fresh target IDs and generations. Removed or
retargeted declarations retain their source proof without granting target
acceptance. These live handoffs use the same validated descriptor projection for
initial provisioning, cold job recovery and receipt reads. Regression coverage
rejects missing handoffs, checks descriptor/install-receipt equality, and covers
lost replies and native reopen. The distributed publication-reply-loss smoke
previously stalled on an empty-only receipt guard and now completes successfully.

Public restore-job views own their idempotency keys and nested result strings
before parsed records are released. A regression overwrites the source buffers
before inspecting the response, and the focused backup/restore target includes
the job listing tests. Response ownership does not depend on allocator reuse.

The retained-transfer fixtures use canonical artifact keys owned by their
logical source document, including multi-fragment proofs across crash/reopen.
The restore benchmark uses a checked allocator without per-allocation stack
unwinding; its unchanged 30-second deadline now measures restore work rather
than Mach-O debug-symbol lookup. These focused suites pass, but their results
are separate from the pending final-binary recovery soak.

## 2026-09-29: progressive native publication across process restart

[Main e2e-full run 36526714836, job 109286926408](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36526714836/job/109286926408)
failed `test_progressive_publication_remains_queryable_across_process_restart`:
after restart the index had 128 native vectors and 64 covered sources, while its
artifact target was 160 vectors. Queryability remained false throughout the
eight-second restore wait. The original assertion did not include the
pre-restart status, so the log alone does not establish the exact pre-restart
native count.

The native posting WAL's immutable generation is the query and restart
authority. Status, certificate validation, and checkpoint count writers
previously read mutable HBC cardinality that could describe the next source
capture. A sidecar count that was absent or ahead of the recovered native
generation could then leave the earlier durable prefix unadmitted after open.
All three paths now read the native serving view. Both the progressive query
gate and status use boundary certificates. An open-time proof retains a
nonempty older native WAL prefix when its source sequence covers the projection
checkpoint, without allowing later status reads to certify a coincidentally
matching live count or an ahead-of-sidecar WAL generation. The restart
regression compares the durable serving vector count and only the source
coverage represented by its two-chunk-per-document fixture; it also prints
its pre-restart status on a restore timeout.

The unchanged main-based binary passed 40/40 focused E2E invocations on four
workers, so that local baseline did not reproduce the CI timing failure. The
deterministic storage regression covers both an ahead-of-WAL sidecar through
an actual DB reopen and an absent sidecar, and verifies that uncommitted live
cardinality cannot inflate reported serving count or mint a certificate.
The fixed, merged-main server binary (SHA-256
`4ef98bc7f3e9d7c82afe83e61a796b64488d1b0a8ad882628a399334e7c2311c`)
passed 200/200 focused E2E invocations with
`scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh` (four workers, 50 repeats each).

## 2026-09-27: PR #885 CUDA build cancelled before qualification

[PR #885 CUDA build job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36345949010/job/108695038652)
was cancelled in `Build CUDA-enabled E2E executable` after 88 minutes 56
seconds in that step, near the job's 90-minute limit. Packaging and the L4
qualification job did not run, so this attempt has no CUDA correctness result.
The [previous approved run of this PR](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36298230764/job/108560988152)
built the same CUDA code successfully in 70 minutes 25 seconds and passed its
[L4 smoke job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36298230764/job/108570816784).
The sole intervening commit changed a nested pytest probe in
`test_standalone_harness.py`, outside the CUDA build. The cancellation is
therefore a build-duration failure rather than an observed GLiNER test
failure. This comparison rules out the final test-harness commit as a cause;
it does not measure whether the broader Decide branch affects baseline build
time. The public job metadata has no compiler progress detail to identify why
this build took longer. Compare bounded-build resource samples and cache state
on another run before changing the timeout or the Decide implementation.

## 2026-09-26: L4 smoke model prefetch in run 36203548073

[CI run 36203548073](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36203548073)
also failed the [L4 Spot smoke job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36203548073/job/108309588813)
at its `Prefetch inference models before server startup` step. Hardware and
CUDA runtime verification passed; the later inference validation did not run.
For the `smoke` scope this step pulls the Gemma 4 E2B GGUF and projector from
Hugging Face. The GLiNER2.5-Decide branch does not change this workflow or
model pull. This is an unrelated prefetch failure and a possible transient
CI issue rather than evidence of a GLiNER regression. The job log
is needed to identify the exact download error and establish whether it
recurred; the public run metadata exposes only the failed step.

The same run's `zig-base / x86_64` job failed two GLiNER boundary assertions
because the Decide dispatch change ran boundary preflight before the existing
runtime qualification rejection. Those are deterministic regressions and are
fixed in the GLiNER branch, rather than classified as flakes here.

## 2026-09-25: non-GLiNER failures in run 36168024127

[CI run 36168024127](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36168024127)
has three failures outside the GLiNER2.5-Decide changes. They are recorded here
for follow-up; no runtime, test, or workflow change for these failures is
included with the GLiNER fixes.

The [ordinary Antfly E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36168024127/job/108198671180)
ran no tests. Pytest's isolation scheduler rejected the collected
`test_index_lifecycle.py` mixed serverless-runtime group because it requires
two Antfly process slots, while the workflow sets
`ANTFLY_E2E_PROCESS_SLOTS=1`. This is a reproducible CI configuration mismatch,
not evidence that an E2E assertion is flaky. A focused local run of that
scheduler group passed with two slots. The workflow setting needs a separate
decision because the single-slot limit also protects multi-node tests from
concurrent disk contention.

The [operator inference job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36168024127/job/108198671285)
failed only `TestInferenceRuntimeContract/lazy` after 240.02 seconds; its other
11 scenarios passed. During the lazy scenario's cold model pull, the log shows
64 MiB of a 127.3 MiB `model.safetensors` file downloaded after about
3.7 minutes at roughly 290 KiB/s. The test's four-minute context includes
that pull and runtime startup, so a download deadline is the likely immediate
cause. The excerpt does not contain the scenario's final error, and one run
does not establish how often this happens. This model is unrelated to GLiNER.

The [recovery-0 job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36168024127/job/108198671138)
failed
`test_fk_cascade_recovers_claims_references_and_rows[transaction_resolve-owner]`
while batching parent rows after the injected owner fault. The request first
received `503 write unavailable` and eventually hit a client read timeout.
Data-node logs include `MetadataSnapshotHeadMismatch` during replica-root
refresh and `LeaderUnavailable` during transaction prepare; metadata Raft
status still showed a leader and matching commit indexes when diagnostics
were captured. Those observations do not identify which condition prevented
write recovery. Preserve the data-group leader and replica convergence
diagnostics on recurrence before changing retry or timeout behavior. This is
an unresolved availability failure, not a confirmed flaky assertion.

## 2026-09-25: physical storage compilation isolation and retained measurements

[Main run 36200131260](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36200131260)
lost its build-cache runner during the physical storage compilation check.
GitHub's annotation reports lost runner communication; no compiler log or
measurement establishes the exact cause, including whether it was an OOM.
The checker now uses the same bounded compiler wrapper as other Zig builds,
and CI restricts its CPU affinity to eight CPUs from the runner's actual mask.
Measurements are published atomically before each build and every 30 seconds,
so an interrupted job retains its last observed RSS and active case. A timeout
kills the build group, retains its report, and marks CPU accounting incomplete.
The cache ownership assertions remain unchanged.

The local matrix also exposed two concrete dependency leaks. The backup cohort
driver imported full read/write implementations in test builds although it
only needed their source contracts. Those literal imports pulled coordination
code into the storage compiler manifest. The C ABI also imported the complete
write coordinator for physical backup pin control. The driver and relational workers now import narrow contracts directly.
Restore validation and consumer fixtures select concrete adapters through
the compilation root instead of literal imports. Backup pin control lives
beside its physical DB owner with a compatibility alias for existing callers. Literal DB implementation imports in source transfer, restore, relational
code, and test helpers also bypassed root ownership. They now select the
physical DB through the existing root mechanism, preserving implementation
identity for physical callers while avoiding compilation in other roots.
This keeps physical storage independent of coordination changes and consumer
code independent of physical implementation changes without weakening the checker.
All ten storage-owner backup regressions passed. The final API selection
passed ten restore/backup tests, including six backup heartbeat cases, and
all 92 transaction regressions passed with the root-selected imports. The complete nine-case
physical compilation matrix passed on frozen source with every original
cache and relink assertion intact (cold, warm, read/write coordination,
physical DB/local query, owner test, consumer root, and shared contract).

## 2026-09-25: PR #889 zig-base runner preemption

[Job 108307916600](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36207700839/job/108307916600)
ended during hermetic unit tests with exit code 130 and an Actions runner
shutdown signal. No test assertion or unit watchdog fired before shutdown.
Kubernetes events for `arc-antfly-heavy-q8vlq-runner-4f668` record scheduler
preemption at 2026-09-26 01:48:37 UTC by higher-priority Pod
`74c343d5-64c3-4ece-a8eb-5e2476f60e95`, followed by a memory-pressure eviction
at 01:48:49 UTC on node `gk3-antfly-ci-pool-2-3a7329dc-9rzj`.
ARC recorded the container's SIGTERM exit (143) and removed the failed runner.

This interruption is independent of the qualification timeout below. The
companion Colony infrastructure change requests GKE Autopilot extended duration
for both heavy runner profiles, allowing GKE to provision system capacity first
and defer automatic upgrades/scale-down. It requires an infrastructure rollout
before a rerun can validate the policy. System-priority preemption and node
memory pressure remain possible; increasing test timeouts or retrying individual
tests would not fix runner provisioning.

## 2026-09-25: VOPR qualification audit failure and cold-build timeout

[PR CI run 36189107289](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36189107289)
cancelled the VOPR `qualify` job at its 120-minute limit. The same job had
already failed the determinism audit because a teardown diagnostic printed a
raw pointer from `full_cluster.zig`. The earlier
[run 36173392068](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36173392068)
reported that audit failure after completing qualification in 99 minutes.
Its build summary shows the physical secret backend root taking 44 minutes
to compile in ReleaseSafe; the regular `zig-base` lane already runs that
target. The restore-admission replay itself took 25 seconds in that run.

The teardown diagnostic now prints only stable sender and shutdown state.
Qualification runs the small audit first and replaces the broad secrets
target with the focused secret lifecycle VOPR replay. This keeps the VOPR
transport, runtime, restore-admission, and secret lifecycle targets in
qualification. The runner logs do not expose which compilation was still
active when the later job timed out, so the
duplicate work is the documented cost source, not a proven explanation for
every minute of that particular timeout.

PR CI dispatches its reusable workflow from `main` and checks out the PR
revision inside the job. Therefore a PR edit to the workflow's inline
qualification command would not run before merge. The workflow now calls a
qualification script from the checked-out revision. A branch workflow
dispatch can use `qualification_only` to validate workflow edits before merge.

## 2026-09-23: executable chunk embeddings and transient rewrite owner routing

[PR #868 CI run 35937420037](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35937420037)
failed both executable embedding artifact restart cases before the restart:
the worker reported zero completed batches and skipped coverage. The planner
classified an embedding that names a directly generated chunk artifact as
inline chunk input. The embedding's `source_field` was `text`, which exists on
the stored chunk but not the parent document. The planner now marks every
named chunk source as materialized input, and the worker routes by that
explicit input kind. The planner regression and focused database suite pass
(309/309); both E2E variants passed four invocations each across two concurrent
soak workers.

The same run's schema rewrite recovery case exhausted its terminal wait at
attempt 9 with `RestoreValidationPending` in the snapshot phase and intermittent
owner/metadata 503 responses. A temporary unavailable owner is readiness for
the already durable rewrite cursor, not a repository failure. The rewrite
driver now maps that condition to a short same-attempt wait; scope-change and
other errors keep their existing handling. The focused rewrite case passed four
two-worker soak invocations. The run also included a seed-write
timeout during slow metadata persistence; this is a separate availability
signature and the rewrite change does not resolve it.

[Origin/main job 107446985962](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35936641093/job/107446985962)
failed a constraint-status poll on the endpoint's documented transient 409
(`refresh and retry`). The lifecycle test now retries only that exact response
while polling. That job also had catalog and foreground traffic failures with
while polling. The corrected retirement case passed four clean two-worker
soak invocations. That job also had catalog and foreground traffic failures with
metadata WAL commits taking up to 12.2 seconds, including time spent in the
physical WAL commit. The E2E base lanes now schedule only one Antfly cluster
workload per runner, preventing another test cluster from contending for the
same disk during bounded-latency assertions. This is CI workload isolation,
not a guarantee of availability when a production disk takes 12 seconds to
commit a WAL record. The CI result after this change is still needed to
validate that contention was the cause on that runner.

## 2026-09-23: older Raft owner descriptor regressed a migrated schema

[CI job 107389740209](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35916384702/job/107389740209)
failed `test_concurrent_tenant_schema_migrations_preserve_documents`. During
startup catch-up, an older committed entry (index 3) carried its original
storage-owner descriptor. The physical DB had already durably installed a
newer schema. Opening the owner tried to commit the older schema and returned
`SchemaVersionRegression`; the C ABI mapped it to an internal storage failure,
which stopped data nodes 102 and 103 and left the migration poll to time out.

The owner open and configuration paths now retain a newer durable schema and
its index definitions when an older descriptor is replayed. A committed Raft
batch no longer revalidates against the replica's current metadata schema:
admission happened before the entry was committed, and the native applied
marker still performs idempotent replay. This keeps metadata arrival order
from changing the outcome of an older committed entry. The exact descriptor
transition has a deterministic compiled-owner test; a DB reopen test checks
that the newer public and runtime schema remain persisted. Both pass. One
unchanged-binary focused E2E invocation passed, so the timing-sensitive CI
failure was not reproduced by that single local run. The rebuilt server passed
four focused E2E invocations across two concurrent regression-loop workers;
those passes validate recovery under local load but do not prove the CI race
cannot recur.

## 2026-09-23: restore staging contention and partial vector publication after restart

[CI job 107069241819](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35823581381/job/107069241819)
and [job 107085992226](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35826961268/job/107085992226)
each failed the same two standalone E2E tests. In
`test_cluster_restore_modes_with_concurrent_observers`, restore attempt 15
reached neither publication nor a terminal error within 120 seconds. Both
server logs identify `StorageBusy` during `authority_or_owner` staging.
This is the remaining [#846](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/846)
signature: the generic error mapping treated transient owner contention as
`RestoreValidationPending`, requeued a fresh durable attempt, and applied
repository-failure backoff. `StorageBusy` now takes the short cooperative
same-attempt yield; ordinary repository errors still use their durable
retry policy. The translator also preserves longer readiness waits raised directly
by cutover fencing. The mapping regression checks all three classifications.

In `test_progressive_publication_remains_queryable_across_process_restart`,
the same index incarnation had 160 searchable vectors before restart and 32
afterward, while source coverage stayed at 80 of 100 documents. The generated
replay and target counters advanced to reflect the reduction, so the failure
is not just a stale status field. Two paths could withdraw old embeddings
before replacement: the chunk producer deleted derived embedding artifacts
while reconciling stale chunk rows, and the chunked dense worker could enqueue
stale embedding deletions before its provider call succeeded. The chunk
producer now cleans its own stored rows and targets only full-text deletions;
the embedding consumer retires its artifacts after successful replacement,
including the materialized chunk path's terminal-outcome check. Synchronous
precomputation likewise retires stale embeddings only after replacement
generation succeeds in the same commit. The restart
regression keeps the provider blocked after a source change, checks that all
previously published vectors survive retry and reopen, and then checks that
the obsolete vectors retire after the provider recovers. This is tracked in
[#867](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/867).
With only the embedding-worker change, that deterministic test failed on
reopen (`expected 3, found 1`); fixing the chunk producer made it pass.

The unchanged `origin/main` binary passed 80 focused invocations across ten
four-worker regression-loop repetitions, so neither CI timing failure was
reproduced by that local soak. The deterministic regressions target the
identified transitions. The fixed server passed eight focused E2E invocations
across two two-worker repetitions, plus the targeted database tests for dense,
sparse, full-text, and synchronous replacement. These passes do not prove the
CI failures had no additional contributing cause.

## 2026-09-22: schema rewrite cutover readiness after coordinator crash

[CI run 35813900420, job 107039234761](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35813900420/job/107039234761)
failed `test_schema_rewrite_recovers_dependency_cohort[publication-coordinator]`:
the restore was still running with `RestoreValidationPending` after its
180-second terminal wait. The retained server logs show import and validation
progress, and the test's old-owner observations reached the fenced/drained
state. The generic job error does not identify which cutover owner was pending;
the stripped CI stacks do not establish a deadlock.

Cutover polls each old owner's topology fence before recording its durable
receipt. An absent write/status response or a not-yet-drained fence is expected
readiness, but previously used `RestoreValidationPending`, which requeued a new
replicated job attempt with exponential repository-failure backoff. Across six
old owners, this can consume the test's recovery window without advancing the
cutover cursor. These readiness checks now park a bounded 250-ms in-memory
continuation of the same durable attempt. The owner receipt and cursor still
advance only after the fence is observed drained; process loss reconstructs
the running job from its durable checkpoint. A read-index status check first
recognizes an already-applied begin, including one whose response was lost, so
short polling does not resend a Raft write on each turn. Actual repository and
validation errors retain their existing retry/fencing behavior.

The unchanged `origin/main` binary passed six focused macOS Debug repetitions
with two concurrent regression-loop workers (roughly 144–162 seconds each),
so the exact CI failure was not reproduced locally. The store's continuation
regression now exercises both yield and readiness-wait paths, including
checkpoint preservation, zero scheduling writes, same-attempt resume, and
leader-recovery fencing. The initial fixed binary passed four concurrent E2E
repetitions; the final revision with read-before-resend passed two more. The
focused restore-job suite passed 42/42. These runs validate integrated recovery
but do not establish a latency speedup or prove the CI failure's exact cause.

See also the [E2E flake history](e2e/FLAKES.md). Record the original evidence,
reproduction conditions, deterministic regression, and before/after results;
a passing soak alone does not establish a failure's cause.

The later [Antfly E2E failures](e2e/FLAKES.md#2026-09-18-concurrent-aggregations-stalled-hydration-and-raced-primary-generations)
add full-text hydration contention, aggregation generation races, and overlapping transaction session recovery;
their deterministic regressions and native soak evidence are recorded there.

## 2026-09-21: restore retry diagnostics vanished while running (#846)

[Issue #846](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/846) records the concurrent
restore/observer test exceeding its 120-second budget at attempt 15, with no
published tables and no error in status. This is real retry churn, not merely
the cooperative staging continuation (which preserves its attempt number).
The retained CI log does not identify the retry cause or establish leadership
instability; the test uses the standalone runtime.

The job store cleared `last_error` both on begin and on ordinary progress
checkpoints. It now retains the last retry reason until a newer reason replaces
it or successful completion clears it. Recovery preserves the original reason,
stale attempts remain fenced, and cancellation retains its explicit reason.
This uses the existing durable record and public `error` field; it adds no
extra persistence or polling. The polling timeout now includes the bounded
server-log tail, just as terminal failures already include diagnostics.

The deterministic negative control restores the old update behavior and fails
because the resumed attempt has no retry reason. The corrected store suite
passes 42 tests, including progress, stale-worker, recovery, and success cleanup
coverage. Two polling tests verify bounded logs and the unchanged deadline even
when every poll reports another attempt. Eight unchanged native macOS Debug
observer runs on two workers pass; the rebuilt fixed server passes another
20/20 on two workers. All 272 metadata logic tests also pass. These runs do
**not** reproduce or prove a
fix for the original CI stall. Keep #846 open for that investigation; no restore
timeout, observer rate, or progress assertion was relaxed.

Reproduce using an isolated local Zig cache and a fresh report directory:

```sh
cd zig
zig build antfly-api-restore-jobs-test --cache-dir /tmp/antfly-832-local-cache
uv run --project e2e/antfly pytest -q e2e/antfly/test_restore_wait.py

```

## 2026-09-21: source-vector status disappeared under contention (#845)

[Issue #845](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/845) observed
`MissingSourceVectorStatus` immediately after reopening an opaque owner under
concurrent E2E load. Source storage was already open: `sourceVectorStats`
returned null both when storage was disabled and when `tryStatsSnapshot` could
not acquire its mutex. JSON omitted that null field and incorrectly reported a
successful, incomplete observation.

The DB observation now distinguishes disabled storage from `StorageBusy`.
The owner ABI returns busy with no response bytes, allowing the existing bounded
`ownerStatusEventually` retry to work. Fresh server status publication similarly
retries contention through its existing `WriterLocked` path; best-effort cached
overlays retain their previous observation. No source mutex wait is introduced
under a shared owner lease, and the reopen test still rejects a successful
response with missing source status.

The deterministic C ABI regression holds the source mutex on the calling thread,
requires busy and empty output, then releases it and requires source status
without another query or write. It also checks a genuinely disabled source store
and runs alongside the existing apply-writer contention regression. Both are
registered in the default C API test selection.

```sh
cd zig
zig build capi-test --cache-dir /tmp/antfly-832-local-cache -- \
  --test-filter 'storage owner runtime status'
zig build antfly-storage-owner-test --cache-dir /tmp/antfly-832-local-cache \
  '-Dstorage-owner-test-filter=opaque storage owner preserves source-vector policy and status across reopen'
```

The old contention-to-null behavior fails the deterministic regression with
`expected .busy, found .ok`. The corrected pair passes 20 invocations on two
workers (40 tests), and the unchanged immediate-reopen test passes another
20 invocations on two workers while compiler work is active. The original issue
used `antfly-storage-test`; the focused current partitioned build target is
`antfly-storage-owner-test`. A separate-cache qualification also passes all
45 compiled owner tests and all 16 index-race/embedded lifecycle VOPR tests.
Do not share a mutable local compiler cache with another active worktree: the
initial broad run mixed consumer artifacts from a schema-format-14 worktree
with this branch's format-13 provider and failed restore digest checks; the
separate-cache build passes those same unchanged tests.

## 2026-09-21: full-lane cache, VOPR storage, and extension failures

[Full run 35641562828](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35641562828)
contained independent failures; passing the smaller required lanes did not cover
them. The full unit aggregate itself passed 2,120 tests (eight skipped).

- The runtime-cache fixture selected an arbitrary compile artifact sharing the
  HTTP runtime module. Different test runners produced different cache keys.
  Select the intended simple-runner artifact before mutating its module. The
  unchanged fixture reproduced its recompile failure; the corrected cache
  contract passes, including the unchanged-build cache hit.
- The index-manager and embedded VOPR roots omitted `antfly_schema_openapi`.
  Register the dependency at each module boundary, including the WASM consumer
  of the embedded configuration helper.
- Native index-root validation consulted only the top-level storage override,
  while backend open also honored nested LSM options. Canonicalize both onto
  the same effective adapter. The regression covers nested configuration and
  explicit-override precedence and later option reconfiguration. Main and WAL
  adapters remain independent. The original exact-replay case reproduced
  `InvalidIndexRootPointer`; advancing past it exposed wall-clock sleeping in
  a virtual-time drain and real-clock validation of a virtual-time lease.
  Drain through the owning I/O, carry the enrichment runtime's clock into its
  transactional fence, and schedule readiness steps as recorded VOPR tasks.
  All 13 index-race and three embedded lifecycle tests pass; exact replay
  retains five repeats per scenario. No lease or timeout was relaxed.
- The 49 GiB CI filesystem filled after the unit phase retained about 38 GiB
  of compiler outputs. Linux self-hosted Debug often emits no disposable link
  objects, so object-only pruning freed nothing. At completed full-job phase
  boundaries, release the job-private `zig-local` outputs **and manifests**;
  preserve global dependencies and installed artifacts. Tests cover symlink
  rejection, sibling preservation, repeated release, and an actual Zig rebuild
  after release. Never invoke phase release while a cache user is running.

The extension failures are deterministic on the full Linux binary. Its static
TLS is 2,099,440 bytes, already larger than Rayon's default 2 MiB compiler-worker
stack. A diagnostic signal handler located the fault in Cranelift's
`Compiler::compile_function` writing to its stack. An isolated invocation works
with small TLS and exits 139 when given a matching large TLS reservation.
Wasmtime core and component engines now disable the global parallel compiler
pool and compile on the existing host worker. This bounds compilation fanout
and uses the host's stack policy; it can reduce cold compilation parallelism.
The large-TLS component invocation then passes, including host write and thread
teardown. Existing full-server extension tests remain the integration gate.

The retained isolated reproducer uses the real component, not a mocked engine:

```sh
cargo build --manifest-path extensions/memoryaf/Cargo.toml --release --target wasm32-wasip2
# Set ANTFLY_WASMTIME_LIB to the pinned v45.0.2 C API shared library.
zig test -O ReleaseSafe -lc --dep wasmtime \
  -Mroot=zig/tools/fixtures/wasmtime_thread_stacks.zig \
  -Mwasmtime=zig/pkg/antfly/src/extensions/wasmtime_runtime.zig
```

Run from the repository root on Linux/glibc. Restoring parallel compilation is
the negative control. Local Linux evidence uses x86 emulation; ARC remains a
separate qualification gate.

## 2026-09-21: avoid duplicate recovery work during persistence pressure

The [online-merge and #841 E2E records](e2e/FLAKES.md#2026-09-21-online-merge-recovery-exceeded-phase-deadlines-in-pr-832-ci)
track the original failures, unchanged runs, and the limits of injected slow-sync
experiments. The merge driver now borrows one step's validated observation,
removes receiver dependencies from donor-only phases, and distinguishes fence
installation from transaction drain. Relational maintenance schedules work on
the current group leader and yields to a contended Raft host mutex. Durable
receipt/authority checks remain responsible for safety across elections.

The owning metadata and session-maintenance suites include regressions for
observation lifetime, drain waiting, unavailable receiver routing, and ownership
transfer without follower RPCs. The data-runtime suite covers the nonblocking
host-lock check. `activation-ownership-negative.log` and
`merge-fence-negative.log` under `.benchmark-results/issue-828/` retain the
controlled old-behavior failures. Severe sustained slow-sync runs still fail;
these changes are not evidence of an arbitrary disk-latency guarantee.

## 2026-09-21: TLA trace producers truncated each other's output

[Issue #828](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/828) records
[run 35549453714's Raft validation failure](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35549453714/job/106181715054):
282 Raft tests passed, but the 434-line trace failed JSON parsing at line 6.
The original raw trace was not retained, so its exact bytes cannot be recovered.

The defect remains on `origin/main` at `a032858819bd89ffcb31e5dcf7e76699babfdc3b`.
`antfly-raft-test` launches multiple executables. Three emit traces, each opening
the same `ANTFLY_TRACE_FILE` with `O_TRUNC` and an independent file offset.
Twelve unchanged native macOS ARM64 Debug runs with `-j8` produced valid JSON,
but retained only 445 events. Running the producers separately produced
445 + 42 + 5 = 492 events: successful parsing concealed lost evidence.

A controlled overlap of the unchanged producer executables reproduced malformed
line 6. Pause the Raft producer after its file reaches 2,030 bytes, run the restore
producer (which truncates it and writes 725 bytes), then resume the first
producer. Both exit successfully; its old offset creates a NUL-filled hole after
the restore producer's five lines. The production segmenter rejects line 6 with
`invalid JSON trace event: Expecting value`. This establishes a producer-ownership
bug with the reported signature, without asserting byte-for-byte identity with
the missing CI artifact.

CI extraction now owns a fresh run directory and each process exclusively creates
its own PID-and-sequence file. PID reuse cannot overwrite earlier evidence.
Raft and transaction loggers also share the mutex protecting their common
buffered writer. Raft segmentation gives each input its own output directory,
so equally named segments from different producers cannot overwrite one another.
Invalid JSON remains fatal; existing model eligibility rules are unchanged.
Both TLA CI jobs retain the raw directory as an artifact after success or failure.

The owning Raft suite includes a regression that interleaves two producer
identities, reuses one identity, resumes the original descriptor, and checks
every file's exact contents. The fixed aggregate retains all 492 Raft events.
Six fresh extraction/validation runs through `scripts/ci/zig-tla-verify.sh` pass,
each validating 18 Raft and 22 transaction model segments. Run from the repository
root with `ANTFLY_TLA_TRACE_VALIDATE=true` and a fresh
`ANTFLY_TLA_TRACE_DIR`; extraction uses the bounded Zig build wrapper.
After rebasing onto main at `227f2dc39c`, another full extraction/validation run
passes all 18 Raft and 24 transaction segments (the additional transaction cases
come from main).

Local raw traces, producer commands, negative-control output, and validation logs
are under `.benchmark-results/issue-828/` in `.worktrees/issue-828-flakes`.
In particular, `raft-overlap-before-2.ndjson`, `trace-overlap-result-2.log`, and
`negative-segment.log` retain the corruption; `tla-script/` and `tla-repeat/`
retain all fixed producers. These are native macOS results, not Linux ARC
qualification. The separate catalog readiness evidence is recorded in the
[E2E history](e2e/FLAKES.md#2026-09-21-catalog-reporter-startup-preceded-protocol-readiness).

PR #832's [first CI run](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35633482490/job/106446151397)
exposed a test-registration mistake in this fix: the normal, non-TLA Raft gate
rejected `trace files preserve overlapping producers` because no declared test
matched that filter. The helper was reachable only through the enabled trace
writer's function body. The standalone helper test and TLA-enabled runs passed,
but did not exercise normal aggregate discovery. A focused non-TLA build
reproduced the missing declaration locally. The tracing module now explicitly
imports the helper in its test block so both build modes discover the regression;
the required filter remains strict. CI evidence and local before/after logs are
`ci-832-unit.log`, `ci-832-filter-negative.log`, `ci-832-raft-fixed.log`, and
`ci-832-raft-tla-fixed.log` beside the other #828 evidence. Both complete native
Raft aggregates pass after the correction, with and without `-Dwith_tla=true`;
each discovers and executes the file-ownership regression.

## 2026-09-18: HTTP cancellation lost a socket published after the watchdog won

[PR #801's x86 unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35382288964/job/105721669088)
hit the idle watchdog after 1,815 seconds. The new per-process progress log
identified `native_chat.test.server request cancellation interrupts a blocked
response`: it entered the test but never reached runner I/O teardown. PID 17421
had 11 threads, waited in `futex_wait_queue`, and had no OOM kill. Debugger
attachment was denied again. This resembles the earlier anonymous stall below,
but the earlier artifacts cannot prove that it was the same test.

The unchanged Debug test reproduced under Linux x86 container emulation on
repetition 41 of one of four concurrent workers. A second instrumented run hung
on repetition 51. Cancellation won before the request registered its socket;
the surviving worker was blocked in a socket read while its caller joined the
request task. Publication's already-canceled branch attempted `netShutdown`,
discarded its error, and continued without installing the cancellation callback.
Because shutdown is itself cancelable, it could return `Canceled` without
shutting down the socket. The subsequent native read had no timeout or callback
to release it after the watchdog had finished.

Socket publication now returns `Cancelled` when cancellation already won.
Every buffered/streamed, pooled/unpooled HTTP/1 path propagates it, including TLS;
existing connection ownership closes or evicts the socket before sending. The
publication mutex still serializes registration against the watchdog's shutdown.
No test timeout was raised and the original chat test is unchanged.

A deterministic regression forces the late-publication ordering with a shutdown
backend that returns `Canceled`, covering buffered and streamed requests with
and without pooling. It fails against the old client, which sends and accepts a
response, and passes with the fix, requiring no server request, output, or retained
pooled connection. All nine client lifecycle tests and the active-read cancellation
and timeout regressions pass on native macOS. The unchanged chat test passes
1,000 Linux x86 Debug repetitions across four workers after the fix. These Linux
results use local emulation; native ARC qualification remains a CI gate.

## 2026-09-17: unit watchdog lost attribution outside the DB partitions

[Run 35298670343's x86 unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35298670343/job/105456824907)
hit the 1,801-second idle watchdog. Both retained DB partition logs ended normally:
138 passed/3 skipped and 1,177 passed/5 skipped, without failures or leaks. The
remaining anonymous executable was `f26151a39b6115e67510f0853223991c/test`, PID 16100,
blocked in `futex_wait_queue` with 11 threads. Both ordinary and elevated debugger
attachments failed with `ptrace: Inappropriate ioctl for device`; no OOM kill was
recorded. The ephemeral runner cache is gone. These artifacts do not identify
the stalled test or establish a runtime deadlock's cause.

Only the DB partition wrapper streamed progress to retained files. Other checked
build runs buffered stderr until exit, including CPU inference's separate simple
runner. Both simple runners now write a separate PID-named log under the existing
`ANTFLY_TEST_LOG_DIR`, recording arguments, test entry, I/O teardown, allocator
teardown, and completion. Diagnostic I/O is independent of the per-test I/O owner.
The existing idle watchdog watches these files, so advancing tests no longer
appear idle solely because their console output is buffered until process exit.
Inventories retain their existing output and do not execute tests. The watchdog
also copies live test executables with their arguments, working directory, and
SHA-256 before termination, so a ptrace denial cannot erase the executable too.
Watchdog limits and test selection are unchanged.

The compiled runner regressions verify that an in-flight test is visible while
stdout/stderr remain captured, then verify both teardown phases and completion.
The retention helper checks exact binary bytes, arguments containing spaces,
digest, and exclusion of compilers. This closes the diagnostic gap; it does not
by itself resolve or reproduce the original hang.

Local CPU-inference runs completed 4,319 selected tests on native macOS (4,261
passed, 58 skipped) and 4,305 on Linux x86 under emulation (3,909 passed, 396
skipped). The emulated run required a 64 MiB stack after the emulator hit its
8 MiB default stack boundary; this is not a native ARC qualification result.
The newer run `35304355356` also passed its x86 base-unit job. These passes do not
identify or resolve the original stalled executable.

The same run's E2E failure was a large-catalog database-create HTTP 503, not a
restore timeout. See the [catalog E2E record](e2e/FLAKES.md#2026-09-17-large-catalog-mutation-failed-during-fast-native-elections).

## 2026-09-17: standby drain stalled behind status-protocol probing

Both standby-scaling shards in [run 35247508165](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35247508165)
failed `ProductionStandbyBaselineDrainTimeout`. Seed `2713408769` reproduced locally:
store reports remained at approximately 2.277 seconds while drain reconciliation
continued. The simulated metadata endpoint exercises compatibility with a peer
that does not yet support `/status/update`. Its 60-second capability-probe delay
shared the worker's publication retry timer, suppressing supported full reports
and leaving drain observations stale.

The worker now separates capability probing from publication retries. Full reports
continue while the newer protocol is unavailable; actual transport failures and
pending baselines retain their existing backoff. The borrowed-`VoprIo` regression
verifies three consecutive full reports, one unsupported probe, and adoption of
the current protocol when the peer upgrades. All nine runtime VOPR tests pass.
With the capability timer fixed, seed `2713408769` completed promotion, split,
merge, scale-in, and exact replay. Seed `11400714822036607254` then exposed a
second defect: full publication carried a `maxInt(u64)` deadline into HTTP.
Three socket timeouts advanced virtual time by approximately 149 days before the
next control round returned `Timeout`. The finding replayed exactly.

Collection now checks cancellation separately and starts a fresh two-second
network budget after the snapshot is ready. Discovery and publication share a
bounded allocation for each remaining metadata endpoint, allowing a later healthy
peer to respond even when the first endpoint stalls. The borrowed-I/O regression
checks the timeout bound and both stalled-head and stalled-publication failover.
Schema progress retains its separate bounded quantum after a successful report,
so slow publication cannot repeatedly exhaust the schema checkpoint budget.
Failure diagnostics also retain the drain catalog snapshot. On the final macOS
ARM64 ReleaseSafe executable, both retained seeds completed promotion, split,
merge, scale-in, and exact replay: 721,262 transitions, two clean histories, zero
failures, replay divergences, or harness errors. Both histories verified quiet
teardown with no live tasks, open files, or open sockets. The executable SHA-256 is
`1f0d8f180d853864057578a5431507f294e62d74bfb7a704d2f9526148d4cb3f`.
Fresh recordings were required after rebuilding because task identities include
compiled function offsets; replaying the previous executable's traces stopped
at the first task identity mismatch, before workload execution. All 48 final
build steps and all 34 runtime VOPR tests pass. Full Linux CI and the scheduled
soak remain separate qualification gates.

The same PR's [x86 unit build](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35247545305/job/105292308708)
exposed a separate C API module-root violation: the restore admission helper was
imported via `../storage` from a module rooted at `capi/db.zig`. Export it from the
owning C API root and use the existing `antfly` module dependency. The production
build and all 12 focused C API tests pass with that ownership corrected.

## 2026-09-17: restore leadership recovery lost proposal error identity

The production E2E job in [run 35247508165](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35247508165/job/105291344795)
recorded repeated restore ownership changes and 120-second completion failures.
The final 100-case run had 16 failures: 11 restore completion timeouts and five
seed-write failures. Retained metadata logs
show `MetadataProposalSuperseded`, `MetadataProposalApplyTimeout`, and WAL commits
around 600 ms. The native 3x3 fixture forced 5 ms Raft and control ticks; it now uses
the executable's production cadence instead of election deadlines shorter than
observed storage latency. This does not change any API completion deadline or
acknowledged-data assertion. Fast virtual schedules remain covered by VOPR.

Proposal supersession and apply-timeout errors were absent from the stable runtime
error ABI. During restore leadership preparation they could become generic
persistence failures and HTTP 500. Preserve their exact identity across archives.
Before public dispatch, leadership preparation may return 503 and rebuild from
committed rows on the next request, including after an unknown write outcome.
This broader recovery classification does not apply to an already dispatched
mutation and does not authorize replay of ambiguous client writes. Restore workers
also recover their exact durable attempt after these outcomes instead of terminally
failing a partially published restore.

The deterministic leadership-rebuild regression injects each outcome through the
real persistence ABI, then verifies successful FIFO recovery. All 29 restore-store
tests, 19 error-boundary/authority tests, and 46 compiled backup/restore tests pass.
The latter require local networking; the sandboxed run was not a valid pass.
A native macOS ARM64 soak of the production recovery changes passed 20/20 cases
across both variants and descriptor profiles. The subsequent publication-budget
change is validated separately by the runtime VOPR tests and retained histories.
See the E2E record for the separate
stalled-discovery HTTP 500, original-log limitations, and production soak coverage.

## 2026-09-16: 3x3 restore owner admission blocked its own bootstrap

[PR #771's base E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35163796459/job/105028671150)
failed `test_three_by_three_cluster_backup_restore_through_metadata_public_api`:
restore job `3531487279743073036` did not finish within 120 seconds. Data node 4
repeatedly failed Raft admission for group `51491842878582563` with
`GenerationTransitionActive`. Other replicas completed runtime repair. The logs
also contain `CorruptLsmWalIndex` while closing old, deleted groups; that diagnostic
alone does not establish the cause of the restore admission stall.

A local 20-case, two-worker baseline reproduced the same 120-second stall and
repeated generation-transition admission errors. A deterministic compiled-owner
regression then forced catalog visibility before bootstrap import: reconciliation
incorrectly returned `complete` and retained an empty physical owner. Its generation
reader prevents bootstrap's exclusive import, so retrying bootstrap cannot heal it.
Both the server point catalog projection and the remote metadata client's owned
point snapshot stripped the restore binding from range records. A regression using
the real remote source on `VoprIo` fails before the client fix and verifies that
both point-read modes and the final owner descriptor retain the exact binding,
even after warming the compact catalog-wide routing cache.

Owner descriptors now retain the range's restore identity. Before opening a cold
owner, the storage kernel verifies that the published generation contains the exact
primary import proof (backup, location, artifact, native manifest, shard path, and
destination group). It holds the validated generation lease through `DB.open`,
preventing a check/open race. Missing or different imports yield retryable
`StorageReadTemporarilyUnavailable` without creating a resident DB. Matching imports
remain admissible while runtime repair is pending; requiring completed repair would
create a second circular dependency. Ordinary owner cache hits do not acquire a new
proof or read a marker. A cached owner with a different or absent admitted restore
binding drains before reopening, preventing an earlier catalog view from bypassing
the check. Register `StorageReadTemporarilyUnavailable` in the compiled failure
registry so this deferral retains its retryable identity across the storage ABI.
The internal storage-owner ABI advances to version 61.

`restore-admission-vopr-test` explores 256 seeded interleavings across nine replica
placements and exact replays each history. It uses the production admission helper,
generation leases, and durable markers on borrowed `VoprIo`. Owner probes compete
with publication on the same replica, including while its exclusive publication
lease remains held across scheduler steps. It checks missing and
mismatched proofs, incomplete primary import, admission before runtime repair
completion, lease release after rejection, and pinning until an admitted reader
releases its lease. The compiled-owner regression covers actual owner admission;
the native soak covers backup import and atomic generation replacement.
The scheduled qualification runs this target. Native scheduled coverage adds
`zig-e2e-cluster-restore-soak.sh`: 50 fresh 3x3 clusters each under normal and
256-descriptor limits, with exact JUnit counts and retained failed roots.

The baseline also exposed two incorrect E2E assumptions: committed deletion may
return `committed_repair_required`, and restore admission may lose its acknowledgement.
The test still requires catalog absence and successful restore, but recovers admission
with one explicit idempotency key and verifies that retries retain the same job ID.
Timeout diagnostics now refresh metadata and retain observed job states. A fifth
failure was a transient `TableTopologyProtocolUpgradeRequired` losing its identity
at the compiled callback boundary and becoming HTTP 500. The merged main catalog
changes register that identity in both failure formats; boundary regressions verify
that the existing HTTP 503 path remains available. The
create harness recognizes the documented text rejections only with explicit
non-admission headers; uncertain/committed outcomes still fail without replay.

A first post-fix experiment ran both profiles concurrently (four six-process
clusters), exceeding the scheduled two-cluster concurrency. It was stopped after
20 completed cases (15 passed, five failed) when the host reached 48,342 TCP sockets
in `TIME_WAIT`, matching the previously recorded local socket-pressure failure.
Failures included lost seed connections, replication/election deadlines, a batch
conflict, and a data control-loop exit with `WriteFailed`; none reproduced the
original restore admission stall. These results do not qualify the native soak.

The fatal write error exposed a separate HTTP boundary defect. A deterministic
injected socket reset returned generic `WriteFailed` instead of
`ConnectionResetByPeer`. The direct HTTP send path now unwraps the network writer's
stored error and retires the failed connection. It preserves uncertain delivery
and makes no automatic mutation retry. Generic non-network writer errors retain
their identity. Executor tests cover GET/POST, one write attempt, delivery state,
and pool retirement; the VOPR status test covers delayed socket failures and the
existing backoff/deadline rules. The injected regression establishes this transport
bug, although the retained process log cannot identify the original socket errno.

An intermediate two-worker run completed 18 cases (16 passed, two setup failures)
before review found the missing remote client projection. The setup failures were
explicit uncertain delete and stateless batch outcomes. The harness now observes
all original table/range identities disappearing after an uncertain delete, and
requires every seeded document's complete payload to appear after an uncertain
batch. It never replays those mutations or treats unresolved outcomes as success.
Five harness regressions cover successful observation, missing/incorrect data,
missing outcome headers, and exactly one mutation attempt. Partial runs from before
the final production rebuild are excluded from qualification.

The first run against the merged catalog executable completed 12 cases (11 passed,
one post-restore assertion failure). The restore job succeeded and all metadata
nodes reported full replication, but a separate one-second topology probe then
returned `None`. That helper conflated transport/HTTP failures with missing tables,
so the exact reason for the extra probe's failure was not captured. The replication
check now returns the exact table/group identities it validated, requires agreement
across all three metadata nodes, and avoids the redundant probe. Backup manifests
must match the captured original groups, and restored documents must still be read
through every data node. Six harness regressions cover a failed later observation,
inconsistent identities, missing placement, missing health, and missing snapshots.

The next two-worker macOS run completed 32 cases (31 passed, one unresolved delete)
under measured host socket exhaustion: Python metadata probes failed with
`EADDRNOTAVAIL`, data control reported `AddressUnavailable`, metadata nodes lost
leader visibility, and the host had 51,921 TCP sockets in `TIME_WAIT`. The restore
had not started. The test correctly failed instead of replaying the uncertain
delete. These results do not qualify the restore soak. Final local validation uses
one six-process cluster at a time (`ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS=1`,
`ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS=50`) while retaining 100 total cases and both FD
profiles. Scheduled Linux coverage keeps two workers and 25 repeats per profile;
local serial results do not establish that parallel macOS runs are reliable.

Final macOS ARM64 ReleaseSafe validation passed all 100 native cases: 50 normal
and 50 with a 256-descriptor limit, one cluster at a time. JUnit verification found
no missing, skipped, failed, or errored cases; the production executable SHA-256
remained `7689b05ded6616b815c904b9e3727c2732fb6573566738ac7ed1427c953f0d15`.
The merged-main runtime suite passed 34 tests, compiled owner source passed 14,
error registry passed one, callback/error boundaries passed 20, and Python harness
and script checks passed 110. All 256 VOPR histories (81 transitions each) and
exact replays passed, as did the determinism audit. Linux CI and the scheduled
parallel profile must validate the original platform separately.

## 2026-09-16: replay-retention fixture timed out on a checkpoint proxy

PR #691's [x86_64 unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35176786855/job/105060523520)
at `37b9910520` failed only
`db async replay truncation retains journal behind generated enrichment`.
`waitForAppliedSequenceAdvance` timed out waiting for `ft_v1` to persist a
checkpoint within 100 ten-millisecond polls. The production E2E job passed,
including the prior shutdown regression. Twenty fresh local Debug processes,
with four running concurrently, did not reproduce this Linux timeout.

The retention fixture used checkpoint appearance as a proxy for a truncation
attempt, then watched the journal for another half second. Neither established
that the truncation callback had finished. A delayed checkpoint is not evidence
of replay loss, and the trace alone does not establish a stuck production worker.
The test now observes the real provider rejection through an event, requests
truncation through the captured source tail, and compares every retained record's
sequence and payload after that call returns. It then permits provider recovery,
drains the production pipeline, checks both durable index checkpoints, and
queries the generated vectors for both documents. This covers retention and
recovery without requiring autonomous checkpoint publication within one second.

The revised case passed 40/40 fresh Debug processes with four concurrent workers.
As a negative control, temporarily removing only the generated-enrichment clamp
in `truncateReplaySequenceAsync` made it fail at the record-count assertion
(`expected 1, found 0`). Restoring the clamp restores the passing test; the
committed change modifies only the fixture and this investigation record. All
five related replay-retention, provider-restart, and index-worker cases pass.

## 2026-09-16: source quiescence freed activity borrowed by transaction callbacks

PR #691's [base Antfly E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35168905132/job/105044672774)
tested `19ffc3c820` and passed the body of
`test_multinode_exact_candidates_follow_redirects_across_entity_shards`, then
failed teardown when data node 101 exited with `SIGSEGV`. The uploaded build
artifact contained only the executable; the failure-log upload glob omitted
multinode roots. CI now retains their node logs, failure diagnostics, and any
captured native stacks as well as standalone logs.

A local Debug repetition failed on the fourteenth run, again during node 101
teardown. This time `endGroupOperationLocked` asserted because a
`ResolveFollowerFanoutTask` finishing `txnResolveGroupLocalWithCancellation`
could no longer find its activity record. `ProvisionedTableWriteSource.quiesce`
freed those records after joining source-owned jobs, before the data server
joined DB-owned promotion workers that could still call the transaction source.
The same premature destruction exists on main. Without a Linux stack, the local
assertion establishes a concrete lifecycle defect but cannot prove the exact
instruction behind CI's segmentation fault.

Source quiescence must close its own job admission and drain those jobs while
retaining bookkeeping borrowed by external callbacks. Final source destruction
releases that state after the caller has joined the DB workers. The regression
holds a real transaction-resolution operation across source quiescence and
requires normal activity release on both success and cancellation; production
E2E keeps its crash-rejecting teardown assertion.
The deterministic regression fails before the fix in `endGroupOperationLocked`
and passes afterwards. The full writer lifecycle target passes all 228 tests;
the merged error-ABI suites pass all 17 tests.
On macOS ARM64, the rebuilt Debug and ReleaseSafe production executables each
pass all 35 resolution/Autograph module cases (including data-node restart) and
20 fresh-cluster repetitions of the originally failing exact-candidate case.
That is 40/40 additional shutdown repetitions with the crash assertion enabled.
Linux CI must still confirm the original platform.

## 2026-09-16: constrained Autograph restart lost retryable owner admission

The second retained-corpus qualification of PR #704 at `81ab94c8b1` failed its
[production E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35126679231/job/104951437450).
All eight VOPR campaign shards and all four corpus replay jobs passed. Under
the 256-descriptor Autograph profile, worker 2, iteration 16,
`test_multinode_autograph_recovers_after_data_restart` completed its assertions
but failed teardown because data node 102 exited with code 1. Its log identifies
`StorageBusy` applying the `documents` Raft entry at index 6. The artifact
`production-e2e-soak` retains the failed root `antfly-zig-scaling-e2e-l3fykcbz`.

The descriptor-pinned committed-entry path used foreground owner acquisition,
which waits up to five seconds for registry/owner admission before returning
`StorageBusy`. The apply driver recognized only writer-unavailable and resource
budget errors as retryable, so the busy result escaped and stopped the process.
The logs do not identify which lease held admission. The regression forces
registry contention, an exclusive owner lease, and publication independently.

Committed-entry admission now makes one attempt and yields conflicts to the
existing Raft pending-apply queue, before encoding the batch. `StorageBusy` and
publication's `StorageReadTemporarilyUnavailable` retain the original term/index
and retry checkpoint. Neither advances the applied watermark, completes a write
waiter, nor marks the command rejected. Recovery replays the same entry identity;
the owner persists that identity atomically with the mutation. Unexpected errors
retain their fatal behavior. This avoids parking the shared progress driver behind an owner
whose maintenance callback may itself need Raft progress.

The same failed root logged `DistributedQueryUnavailable` becoming
`RuntimeBoundaryFailure` and then `InternalFailure`. Register that exact
retryable identity in both callback and owner failure formats so the HTTP layer
can retain its existing 503 behavior. The new cross-unit callback assertion
failed before the fix with exactly that identity loss.

The Autograph step was misleadingly green because GitHub's implicit Bash shell
did not enable `pipefail`; `tee` hid the script's nonzero exit. The final JUnit
evidence check correctly failed the job. Explicit Bash now propagates pipeline
failures while retaining logs. Injected failures in all three production
pipelines fail against the original workflow and preserve their exit status
with the fix. The existing 200-case Autograph soak, including restart and
teardown checks in both profiles, remains enabled. The Raft checkpoint regression
also runs in scheduled VOPR qualification.

## 2026-09-16: Debug stack unwinding escaped a fresh VOPR fiber

Local macOS ARM64 Debug profiling of `origin/main` (`70098c101d`) crashed in
these borrowed-runtime tests:

- `db apply fences wait through their borrowed runtime`
- `graph ownership cleanup runs on borrowed VoprIo before replicated merge`
- `background maintenance services lifecycle runs on borrowed VoprIo`
- `ttl runtime executes production pass on borrowed VoprIo`
- `transaction recovery executes production pass on borrowed VoprIo`

The apply-fence case also failed with timing instrumentation disabled. The
reported segmentation fault was at address `0x8`; stack-trace printing then
stalled. DebugAllocator captures allocation/free traces on the VOPR task stack,
so stack unwinding itself can cause this fault before any diagnostic is printed.

`Kernel.createTask` initialized the fiber frame pointer to zero, but `Entry.entry`
left ARM64's link register inherited from the scheduler. Metadata-based unwinding
could follow that unrelated return address and interpret the null frame pointer
as another frame. A standalone task-kernel regression reproduced the same
`EXC_BAD_ACCESS` at `0x8` in `std.debug.Dwarf.SelfUnwinder.nextInner` under LLDB.
The equivalent x86_64 synthetic return-address slot was uninitialized too.

The entry trampoline now initializes the nonexistent caller's return address to
zero on both architectures. This costs one instruction at task entry and leaves
normal context switches unchanged. Allocator diagnostics and stack tracing stay
enabled. The regression captures a complete trace and exercises DebugAllocator
both before and after yielding the same task back to the scheduler.

After the fix, macOS ARM64 Debug passed all **32 runtime adapter tests**, including
the five failures, and all **167 VOPR library tests**. The standalone task-kernel
suite also passed all **14 tests in ReleaseSafe**.
The five reported cases additionally passed **20 fresh processes / 100 cases**
with zero skips, failures, or leaks. The 14 task-kernel tests passed in Debug on
Linux x86_64 under local container emulation. The pre-fix standalone regression
also passed there, so the Linux run validates the fix but does not establish a
Linux reproduction of the macOS fault.

## 2026-09-16: metadata ownership fixtures bypassed Raft serialization

PR #704's [x86_64 unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35052615288/job/104656431732)
at `fadf936c29` aborted in
`metadata ownership preserves same-id remote backfill observations`.
The restore supervisor's `ensureLinearizableRead` called Raft `readIndex` while
`Scheduler.ready_pass_active` was true, failing the scheduler's non-reentrancy
assertion. The graph-repair and resolver-reopen regressions from the preceding
failure both passed; the SDK, ARM codec, and base E2E suites also passed.

The ownership fixtures added in [#737](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/737)
start a real metadata server, including its asynchronous restore supervisor, but
four calls in two fixtures advanced
`svc.raft.runRaftRoundOnly()` directly. The supervisor uses the owning
`MetadataHttpService` runtime mutex; those raw-host calls bypassed it. Production
service round and read-barrier entrypoints already share that mutex.

The fixtures now advance through `svc.runRaftRoundOnly()`, preserving the live
supervisor and serializing Ready processing with its read barriers through the
existing `std.Io.Mutex`. This fixes the invalid concurrent caller, without
weakening the scheduler assertion, disabling background work, or adding another
lock to the Raft hot path. Both the placement/restart fixture and all four
ownership-projection cases use the same service boundary.

With native localhost socket access, the unchanged `fadf936c29` binary reproduced
the same backfill-test abort in repetition 32 of a four-process runner: the
restore supervisor entered `resumeGroupOnActivity` through ReadIndex during an
active Ready pass. The runner stopped scheduling new work after that failure;
34 other processes completed successfully. Sandbox-only runs skipped all eight
listener-dependent tests and are not counted as validation.

After the fix, the failed CI shard's exact runtime filter/skip selection passed
all **207 tests** locally with native sockets, zero skips, failures, or leaks.
The separate read-cadence regression also passed, verifying linearizable reads
do not take over the election/heartbeat clock.
All eight ownership cases then passed **200/200 fresh processes (1,600 test
executions)** with four concurrent processes and native sockets, with no skips,
failures, or leaks. Formatting and diff checks passed. These are local results;
standard CI and full-soak qualification must be checked for the pushed commit.

## 2026-09-15: graph repair yield accounting and independent resolver completion

PR #704's [x86_64 unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35044256661/job/104631027746)
at `95b0e74334` failed `db index repair streams graph artifact rebuild in batches`
with `expected 2051, found 0`, then aborted while freeing the fixture's writes.
The separate DB-core partition failed
`db resolver workers recover pending journal targets after reopen without new writes`
because resolution still required catch-up. The previous replay-truncation
regression completed; this run did not hit the idle watchdog.

The graph repair wrapper converted activation-budget exhaustion into an empty
`yielded` result, dropping the work count even after durable snapshot construction.
A one-millisecond activation budget deterministically forces this path because it
cannot cover the five-millisecond publication reserve. The graph batching
regression now exercises that yield, checks retained work and candidate state,
reopens the DB, and verifies activation reuses the same candidate without another
batch flush or recounting previously completed work. The wrapper retains the
current turn's completed-work and discovered-artifact-debt counts on a deadline
yield. This adds no scans or storage I/O. Production pause limits and retry policy
remain unchanged. The original CI log did not retain repair state,
so it cannot independently prove which early-return path produced its zero count.

The fixture also left function-scoped `errdefer` frees armed after handing its
last key/value pair to the writes list. A later assertion error freed that pair
twice. Allocation-to-list transfer now has a local scope, so assertion failures
report normally and the list remains the sole owner after append.

Resolver output publication and resolution checkpoint/backfill completion are
independent. The test waited for promotion and two sink writes, then immediately
asserted resolution was idle. Its completion condition now checks both stages;
it keeps the existing bounded wait and still tests automatic recovery without
new writes for both pending-resolution and pending-promotion reopen cases.

Before the production accounting fix, the forced graph-yield test failed with
`expected 2051, found 0`; the corrected fixture cleanup reported that assertion
normally, without an abort or leaks. Repeating the two original tests against
`95b0e74334` reproduced the resolver failure in fresh process 75 (74 prior passes).

After the fix, all 20 focused repair/resolver tests passed in ReleaseSafe,
including graph and full-text replacement, corrupt-artifact debt, activation
budget yielding, and dense candidate yield/reopen accounting. The graph-yield
and resolver-reopen cases passed **200/200 fresh processes (400 selected test
executions)** with four concurrent processes, no skips, failures, or leaks.
Formatting and diff checks passed. These are local regression results; standard
CI and full-soak qualification must be checked separately for the pushed commit.

## 2026-09-15: merged runtime-lane assertions and replay fixture deadlock

PR #704's [x86_64 unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35025324900/job/104571966002)
at `7c061722ac` failed the Raft service-worker test twice, then terminated after
1,801 seconds without log progress. No OOM kill was recorded. These were
merge regressions, not evidence of an intermittent production race.

The Raft host had been assigned `raftOutboundIo()` while the merged test and
runtime ownership contract required `runtime.io()`. Native runtimes give those
lanes distinct identities. Host synchronization/reconciliation now use the
general owner runtime; transport retains its dedicated outbound lane. The VOPR
regression supplies distinct general and outbound runtimes with different clock
values and checks both identities, in addition to the native worker-budget and
rollback test.

A local run of the DB-core complement reproduced the stall in
`db async replay truncation retains durable enrichment debt`. A native stack
sample showed its main thread parked in `truncateReplaySequenceAsync` on the
repair-pin mutex. The fixture had locked that mutex and installed an incomplete
fake vtable in `AsyncContext.io`, expecting its wait callback to unlock it.
Truncation correctly uses `index_manager.checkpointIo()`, so the fake callback
could never execute. The durable-retention fixture now tests the journal
watermark directly. Contention remains covered by the real scheduled VOPR test
`db replay truncation waits for repair pins through borrowed VoprIo`, including
both truncation entrypoints and an absent operation-level Io override. The
owner's synchronization authority remains stable throughout the operation.

CI's checked Run output buffered the entire unfinished DB partition, while its
stack-dump selector missed named `*-tests` executables. Partition output now
also streams to per-process logs, including a test name without its final
newline. The watchdog observes those logs, prints their tails on failure, and
includes named test executables in stack capture; the workflow retains the logs
as artifacts. A process handshake regression verifies partial output is visible
before the child exits and a nonzero child status is preserved. This preserves
the existing watchdog limits rather than masking a blocked test with more time.

Validation: all three focused Raft host cases and six managed-Raft contracts
passed with native socket access. The three replay retention/repair-pin/restart
cases passed; the retention and repair-pin cases also passed 20 fresh-process
repetitions (40 executions). All 32 `vopr-runtime-test` cases passed without
skips or leaks. Workflow lint, 55 CI policy tests, three partition-runner tests,
and two validation-scope tests passed. This is local regression evidence; fresh
standard CI and full-soak qualification must be checked separately.

## 2026-09-15: snapshot ownership leaked between cooperative tasks

Review of #704 reproduced a pre-existing `SnapshotAdmission` bug on both
`096a1f9e4` and `origin/main` (`0fb01a4add`). A VOPR task acquired capture and
slept for ten virtual milliseconds. Before advancing time, another task acquired
mutation admission on the same OS thread and reported `capture_active=true`,
`mutation_overlapped=true`, and `lease_bypassed=true`. Thread-local ownership
mistook an unrelated task for the capture owner. The same mechanism also made
leases unsafe to transfer between native Io workers.

Admission now belongs to explicit operation leases. Nested mutations retain a
shared lease without re-entering the writer-closed gate. Capture lends a scoped
mutation capability to its catalog guard. Bulk-ingest nested batches pass their
parent lease; LSM maintenance calls its admitted helper. Dense replay passes the
exact catch-up session token through both manual and Io executor callbacks,
retains its lease under the session-map mutex, and rejects stale or mismatched
tokens. Closing the session cannot retire a lease still held by an active batch.
Ordinary acquisition remains allocation-free; waits use the owner's `std.Io`.

Five admission regressions cover independent VOPR tasks, cancellation, a queued
capture with an explicitly retained mutation, capture-owned maintenance, and
release on a different native Io worker. They passed **200/200 fresh processes
(1,000 test executions)**. The DB token regression also checks that a retained
batch keeps capture excluded after session close and that closed/wrong-index
tokens cannot borrow admission. These cases run in `vopr-runtime-test` and
production VOPR qualification. The focused DB integration run passed 28 cases
(native snapshots, concurrent capture/writes, bulk ingest, and replay-worker
lifecycle), with one LSM-backend fixture skip and no leaks. The final
`vopr-runtime-test` run passed all 25 storage/runtime and seven DataServer tests
with no skips or leaks. Full-soak results must be associated with the new commit;
an earlier-head soak cannot qualify this fix.

## 2026-09-15: runtime-bound apply locks delayed handoff by polling

Review of #704 found that binding `ApplyRwLock` to the DB runtime selected
50-microsecond to 1-millisecond sleeps, while unlock skipped the futex wake for
bound locks. This affected ordinary native DBs as well as VOPR. A native
ReleaseSafe handoff probe (30 fresh reader tasks, each parked behind a writer
for two milliseconds) measured **617 microseconds average / 1,252 worst** from
unlock to acquisition on `256bb99782`, versus 4 / 11 for the unbound native lock.
These are local latency measurements, not production throughput estimates.

Contended acquisition now captures the wake epoch before checking admission and
parks on the owner's `std.Io` futex. Unlock advances the epoch and wakes that
same runtime. Sequentially consistent waiter registration and epoch rechecking
let uncontended unlock avoid the wake call without losing a concurrent waiter.
The last priority reader signals unconditionally: checking a separate writer
count could miss a concurrently registering writer on a weakly ordered CPU.
DB apply and snapshot admission, plus HBC publication and cache locks, are bound
before use. A caller's separate filesystem/request I/O lane cannot move the wait
to a different scheduler. Writer intent, reader priority, and cancellation
cleanup retain their existing admission rules.

Backend task cancellation wakes its futex directly. Callback-only cancellation
tokens lack wake registration, so their futex waits retain a one-millisecond
cancellation recheck; unlock still wakes immediately. Dense-posting admission
uses one absolute 50-millisecond deadline on the owning runtime clock, including
VOPR, instead of polling the host clock. Timeout releases writer intent and the
reader gate, leaving repair work pending.

The deterministic regressions cover shared/exclusive handoff without advancing
virtual time, an unlock between failed admission and parking, and deadline and
callback cancellation after closing reader admission. The no-clock-advance
regression fails against the old lock with `LockWaiterDidNotPark` and passes
after the change. They run in
`vopr-runtime-test` and production VOPR qualification. The native contention
regression uses `std.Io.Group.concurrent` for both bound and unbound locks.
The same handoff probe after the fix measured **6 microseconds average / 20 worst**
for the bound lock (unbound: 7 / 29). Four snapshot admission tests pass. The
14-test lock suite passed 200/200 fresh processes (2,800 test executions),
including four million writes across the native bound/unbound exclusion test.
`zig build vopr-runtime-test -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -j1` also passes: 18
storage/runtime adapter tests and seven DataServer tests, with no skips or leaks.

## 2026-09-15: multi-node Autograph promotion stalls with an untransportable read timeout

[The base E2E shard](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34928784180/job/104259435053)
failed `test_resolution.py::test_multinode_autograph_resolves_promotes_and_hydrates_entities`
on `4dedffc703eb4aa744ae89d1d9fbd0ddc4b97931` (`codex/spfresh-segment-wal`).
[The linked aggregate job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34928784180/job/104263235408)
only reports that shard failure. The shard finished with 447 passes, five skips,
and one failure. Neither `person/ada_lovelace` nor `org/antfly` became visible
within the 115-second promotion deadline. Its last lookup returned HTTP 500;
the server logged `runtime callback returned untransportable error method=lookup
err=ReadIndexTimeout`, `RuntimeBoundaryFailure`, and resolution
`StorageKernelFailure`. Startup also logged `WriterLocked`. Attempts to capture
six native process stacks were denied by ptrace policy.

The failed revision lacks the `read_index_timeout` semantic identity and the
public/internal read availability mapping already in #704. These preserve the
error through the compiled callback and HTTP client boundaries and return
503 with `Retry-After`, without weakening the Raft read barrier. The boundary
round-trip and public-read parity regressions exercise this concrete error.
The failed revision already contains bounded read-owner admission: that earlier
fix alone did not prevent this failure. There are no usable stacks proving a
new resolver/Raft deadlock in that CI job.

Local production repetitions on the merged-main executable (SHA-256
`710889d55cec215eeffd136ccf0327487cbb3b84d8cc99443f5ab330b42c7658`)
reproduced **two failures in 100 fresh clusters**: normal 48/50, descriptor-limited
50/50. Another 50 normal cases passed, illustrating why a rerun cannot clear the
failure. Twenty repetitions of the original CI Linux executable under local
emulation passed; that is not equivalent to native Linux CI qualification.

The retained LSM tables from a local stall contain a generation-one resolution
artifact with both canonical entities and a durable promotion replay record at
sequence 3. Resolution and promotion report target/applied 2, while the graph is
ready at 3 and the entity table is empty. Runtime initialization restored only
the applied checkpoint, losing the volatile target on reopen. Both stages now
recover their target from their own durable replay lane, independently of graph
progress. The deterministic DB regression forces reopen before resolution and
after resolution/before promotion, checks that the journal contains pending
work, then requires completion without another write or synchronous drain. It
fails before the change and passes with it, alongside the existing backfill and
catalog-fencing regressions. The original CI's final read timeout is not by itself
proof that its entire history followed this same reopen path.

The new production data-restart case also exposed `AddressUnavailable` escaping
the lookup callback as `RuntimeBoundaryFailure`/HTTP 500. Known read-transport
failures now become `StorageReadTemporarilyUnavailable` before that boundary;
cancellation, timeouts, and unexpected defects retain their distinct meanings.
An injected failing transport verifies that normalization makes one attempt and
does not silently retry or return a missing document.
The pre-fix restart experiment failed 7/10 cases (three HTTP 500s and four
promotion deadlines); its native stacks and roots are retained. Startup also
returned `TableNotFound` from routed batch validation before invoking the writer.
That now retains the existing `Unavailable`/503 response with the explicit
`not_proposed_v1` outcome, rather than reporting an ambiguous HTTP 500. The
operation regression asserts the writer was never called on those failures.

The first corrected executable (`05ee0bf5c6`, SHA-256
`c0c7056ebc8594d31d6d59a5838fcd9f6578dab9024e676e5639152151b110a2`)
still failed **3/10 restart cases**: two second-document `WriterLocked` failures
and one promotion deadline. Its retained log also caught a shutdown use-after-free:
`PromotionRuntime.workerStep` called `GroupLeadershipSource.isLocalLeader` through
a freed `ManagedHttpHostService` (`0xaaaaaaaaaaaab1da`, process exit `SIGABRT`).
The provider shutdown barrier closed inline caches but skipped compiled owners,
whose workers survived until after Raft destruction. Compiled-owner quiescence
now fences admission, drains leases, and joins workers before destroying Raft or
provider callback contexts. Its regression holds an actual promotion callback
across shutdown using `std.Io.concurrent` and verifies admission stays closed.
Restart and final teardown now reject spontaneous crashes and retain failure
diagnostics instead of silently replacing or discarding the failed process;
intentional bounded-stop `SIGKILL` remains a crash-recovery case.

Compiled owner open also started resolver workers before reconciling the
authoritative resolver configuration. A worker could hold the resolver catalog
fence and make that configuration return `WriterLocked`. Open now defers those
workers until configuration completes, matching the resident-cache lifecycle.
Unchanged resolver refreshes also used the mutation fence and rewrote the
catalog. With a distributed promotion in flight this could return `WriterLocked`,
retire the owner, and repeatedly make promotion return `StorageBusy`. Exact
configuration equality now uses a short catalog read lock and skips allocation,
catalog persistence, and the replay mutation fence. Changed configurations still
require that fence. The catalog regression holds each replay mutex in turn and
requires an unchanged refresh to succeed while a changed refresh remains fenced.
The compiled-owner suite passes all ten cases with no skips or leaks. The
unchanged/changed resolver fence and both replay/reopen regressions also pass.
The corrected production executable from `256bb99782` (SHA-256
`58c637b81274785e5502f6f208fb45c2da90502295686e99c710b898ba54c99c`)
passed ten restart probes and the full local 200-case Autograph soak: 100 normal
and 100 under a 256-descriptor limit, with exactly 50 ordinary-resolution and
50 data-restart cases per profile, zero failures/errors/skips, and the same
executable hash after completion. These results precede the apply-lock handoff
fix above; they do not qualify a later executable or establish the cause of the
original CI read-timeout history.

The E2E poller now stops on unexpected HTTP errors, including 500, instead of
hiding them behind a generic promotion timeout. Only 503 with `Retry-After` and
transport timeouts/disconnects are retryable. Its original deadline still applies.
The first failure captures native stacks with a five-second per-process limit;
teardown reuses that snapshot and stores it with the retained server root.
macOS uses `sample`; the disposable Linux launcher opts test children into
debugger attachment and the scheduled job installs GDB. Poll deadlines that
fall below the request floor still report pending keys and graph diagnostics.

The full nightly/manual soak now runs the production Autograph scenario under
both normal and 256-descriptor limits, two concurrent workers and 25 repetitions
per case per profile: **200 fresh six-process clusters**, split equally between
the original case and a case restarting all data nodes after the initial write.
Reports are distinct from the
200 restore repetitions and must contain the exact expected test names and
counts with no skips or failures. A failed normal profile does not prevent
collecting constrained-profile evidence, and either failure fails the soak.
The source revision and retained production executable identify the tested bytes.
Run locally against a prebuilt executable with:

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=1 ANTFLY_BIN="$PWD/zig/zig-out/bin/antfly" \
  ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPORT_DIR=/tmp/autograph-soak-reports \
  scripts/ci/zig-e2e-autograph-soak.sh
```

The poller/helper regressions pass locally (29 tests), as do the six regression
orchestration tests, including profile isolation and failure propagation.
Post-fix production repetition and Linux qualification results are pending; adding a
soak is not proof that the progress failure is fixed.

## 2026-09-15: distributed-data materialization fails during exact replay

[The second full soak](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34927431365)
failed distributed-data history 6 during replay with
`VoprIndexMaterializationIncomplete`. The recording completed four transitions
without property failures. The retained trace is
`history-6-b54cda599d6a3d7e.voprtrace`, seed `13064056697522896254`; its original
Linux executable SHA-256 is
`163c27a17d1a0943f766840998bc9678fc88300578f126a4fea717a3700128fa`.

The unchanged trace passed 30 native macOS replays, 25 emulated Linux replays,
and [200 fresh-process native Linux replays under GDB](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34993873598).
The retained log contains all 200 completed four-transition replays. Those
passes do not explain or clear the original failure. The materialization helper
uses 40 immediate repair polls; durable repair backoff uses host time. A normal
activation-budget miss became a failed attempt with roughly 30 seconds of
backoff, which the helper does not wait out. Budget exhaustion now returns the
existing cooperative-yield result and keeps the durable candidate runnable;
missing replay progress and actual storage errors retain failure handling.
A deterministic regression gives activation less than its fixed publication
reserve, requires no failure streak/backoff, then completes the same candidate
with a sufficient budget. All four focused activation, coverage-failure, and
candidate-resume tests pass locally. This independently validated scheduling
fix is not proven attribution of this particular CI history.
Native diagnostics now retain repair phase, attempt,
failure streak, retry deadline, and last error when a replay fails.

## 2026-09-15: standby/scaling corpus runner lost during cache publication

[Corpus job 104276235667](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34927431365/job/104276235667)
completed replay/merge validation and uploaded the small diagnostics artifact.
The runner then lost communication during `actions/cache/save`; GitHub's check
annotation reports runner loss, and full artifact retention was cancelled.
Both scaling campaign shards passed. This is not evidence of a scaling assertion
or replay failure, and the available log does not identify why the runner died.
The workflow now retains the complete merged corpus before publishing its working
cache. Cache publication still fails the job on failure; it is not treated as a
passing seeded soak. The second full run failed independently in distributed-data.

## 2026-09-14: soak qualification exceeds declared compiler memory (#704)

[Qualification job 104248350481](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34927431365/job/104248350481)
on `0f56ccd77e` reports a Linux ReleaseSafe compilation peak of
13,255,065,600 bytes against a declared upper bound of 7,516,192,768 bytes
(7 GiB). The production DataServer VOPR artifact uses
`productionVoprCompileMaxRss`; the separate background-adapter artifact has its
own declaration. The eight standby lifecycle tests and seven DataServer runtime
tests shown in the log passed with zero skips, failures, or leaks. The completed
qualification job succeeded with 27/27 build steps. Zig 0.16 records this RSS
overrun as a diagnostic without returning `MakeFailed`; it is an inaccurate
build-scheduling reservation, not a test failure or a killed compiler.

The shared production-owner compile reservation now uses 16 GiB on Linux, with
headroom over the observed 12.35 GiB peak; macOS keeps its existing 18 GiB
reservation. This allows Zig to account for the actual compiler footprint when
admitting concurrent build steps. It does not alter production memory limits,
suppress resource checks, reduce test coverage, or retry away the failure.
The revised reservation passed [Linux qualification on `43b79fc10b`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34993639738/job/104465497701).
The second full soak failed separately in its distributed-data replay;
qualification itself passed.

## 2026-09-14: standby/scaling read fails after sibling merge (#704)

[Adversarial scaling job 104181278895](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34899531048/job/104181278895)
on `919fa9d124` completed two histories with one clean and one failed history.
Both received exact replay; there were no harness errors or replay divergences.
The failure was a document lookup returning generic HTTP 500 after the automatic
sibling merge, immediately before scale-in. `history-completes` and
`promotion-and-topology-converge` failed; `owners-quiesce` passed with zero live
tasks, files, or sockets after teardown. This is a failed soak, not a timeout.

The failed history is `history-1-9e3779ba20f0d116.voprtrace`, seed
`11400714822035230998`, mutated at choice 251091 from the first history of
campaign seed `2712032513`. The original Linux executable SHA-256 is
`8d44bc8e6ba94292e93b68b57369aa6f74bd31fceb261d49a7aaf85e9d448a5c`.
The trace, mutation schedule, flight recording, and reports are retained in
run artifacts `vopr-run-ha-scaling--1` and `vopr-diagnostics-ha-scaling--1`.
Several earlier merge observations report `UnknownGroup`; that alone does not
identify the later lookup error.

The [original Linux diagnostic replay](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34913890221)
captured `ReadIndexTimeout` in the HTTP transport's concrete error argument for
`GET /db/v1/tables/tenant_b_docs/documents/tenant%3Aq`. The adversarial suffix
advances time by roughly a minute while tasks remain pending. The production
Raft read barrier correctly expires without returning an unproven read, but
the public lookup adapter omitted this availability error and emitted generic
HTTP 500. This request reads the separate tenant table; the preceding sibling
merge and its `UnknownGroup` observations do not establish a merge defect.

Test-linked executables suppress HTTP stderr to preserve Zig's test protocol.
The debugger now captures the transport function's concrete error argument,
numeric value, and request without changing the retained executable or its
schedule. An ingress-only breakpoint missed inlined code; a source-line
breakpoint exposed the error-union discriminant rather than the error payload.
Symbol-based transport diagnostics avoid both problems. Native macOS replay of
this Linux trace diverges at the first scheduled task and is not reproduction
proof.

The fix preserves `ReadIndexTimeout` through typed internal read operations,
internal HTTP responses, and client decoding. Public lookup and pre-stream scan
return HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 1`, using their existing group-unavailable
response. Explicit request deadlines remain HTTP 504, and unexpected storage
errors still propagate as failures. The Raft barrier's quorum/apply requirement
and timeout budget are unchanged.

The focused public-read regression failed on the baseline with
`ReadIndexTimeout` (one executed test, zero leaks). It now exercises lookup and
scan, the typed internal lookup and its HTTP/client round trip, explicit
deadline handling, and fail-closed corruption handling. Existing production
DataServer VOPR coverage also forces a real read-barrier timeout by pausing Raft
drivers and verifies that no waiter remains. The updated public API parity suite
passed all 192 tests with zero skips, failures, or leaks. Final Linux CI and
full-soak qualification remain pending.

## 2026-09-14: restore publication races storage-owner users (#704)

[CI job 104174381057](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34899514358/job/104174381057?pr=704)
on `919fa9d124` failed `test_cluster_restore_modes` during cluster overwrite
restore. The public restore job reported `InternalFailure`; the retained server
log showed staged repair complete, then `table restore failed phase=execution
class=StorageBusy` and `cluster restore failed phase=materialization
class=StorageBusy`. This is separate from the earlier transaction HTTP 503.

The unchanged native executable reproduced the same signature **5 times in 100
fresh-server repetitions** (four workers, 25 iterations each; 95 passed).
Binary SHA-256: `ae0f4294a59fd9eb0b90a58e5516e927927fa47d456bdd9a89abfe5d109dbdce`.
Evidence is retained in `/tmp/pr704-919-restore-modes-soak.log`,
`/tmp/pr704-919-restore-soak-evidence.json`, and its five retained server roots.
The failing immediate-busy retirement function and restore caller were identical
to `origin/main`; the retirement check dates to #536. This establishes a
pre-existing handoff defect, but no matched base-binary reproduction establishes
whether #704 changed its probability. A passing transaction soak is not evidence
that this restore race is fixed.

Table generation admission does not drain every storage-owner borrower: status
and maintenance can already hold leases. Publication previously returned busy
immediately, and retirement alone would allow a replacement owner to open after
the last old entry closed but before namespace exchange completed.

Publication now closes group admission under the owner registry mutex, drains
existing users and owner shutdown using the operation's I/O and cancellation,
and retains the gate across physical publication, catalog commit or rollback,
and staged snapshot destruction. Timeout/cancellation releases the gate while
existing leases keep their owners alive. Ordinary reads encountering the gate
return temporary unavailability so callers can refresh their catalog descriptor.
The same contract covers restore reconciliation and Raft snapshot installation.

The deterministic compiled-owner regression forces a held read, status, or
maintenance lease to release at the first drain wait. It checks successful
handoff, exclusion after the entry disappears, and timeout/cancellation cleanup.
The production restore composition runs real maintenance and status workers
across portable/native restore, rejected publication, and reconciliation. The
scheduled VOPR workflow also runs repeated public cluster restores with
concurrent document reads and index-status observation, retaining failure roots
and the exact executable. These production stress runs complement replayable
VOPR campaigns; their OS schedules are not replay traces.

The new concurrent HTTP case also failed on the unchanged executable with
HTTP 500 and `GenerationTransitionActive` in the server log
(`/tmp/pr704-publication-observer-baseline.log`). Lookup and pre-stream scan
admission now translate that retryable identity and bounded `StorageBusy` into
the existing structured storage-unavailable 503 with `Retry-After`. The response
contract regression covers both routes. The stress test rejects arbitrary 500s
and unclassified 503s and does not retry a restore request.

Native post-fix validation passed all 56 build steps, six compiled-owner tests,
and 192 public HTTP contract tests. Twenty additional owner-suite repetitions
passed all 120 test executions without leaks. The public restore soak passed
**200/200 fresh-server cases**: 100 original mode tests and 100 with concurrent
read/status observers, four workers, no retries of failed restores and no skips.
All used executable SHA-256
`410911f311beeec02a44d723357e6f4d17edd5f81d28f325d3bc30005450f89a`;
the digest was checked again after the soak. Evidence:
`/tmp/pr704-publication-focused-build-approved.log`,
`/tmp/pr704-publication-owner-soak/verified.json`, and
`/tmp/pr704-publication-final/verified.json` with individual JUnit reports.
Linux CI and the separately reported scaling finding remain outstanding.

## 2026-09-14: standby VOPR promotion overtakes apply (#704)

[Full soak 34878521929](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34878521929)
on `03e1a8e0d2` stopped both standalone standby shards with
`PromotionRequiresForce`, at histories 171 and 759. The other six campaign
shards and all four corpus jobs passed. Those partial results do not qualify
the full soak, and no second required-seed run was started.

The lifecycle scenario obtained a non-forced fence after catching up, then
allowed another primary append and standby receive before promotion. The
production standby correctly rejected promotion with unapplied received data;
the scenario propagated that expected refusal as a fatal harness error.
The scripted regression reproduces the same error, then covers rejection,
restart, another rejection, apply, successful promotion, and former-primary
assessment with exact replay. Explicit forced promotion remains covered too.

The scenario now records the refusal as a rejected transition. A separate
safety property checks the applied-tail requirement and verifies rejection
preserves identity and progress. Unexpected errors still escape. Production
promotion rules and force authorization are unchanged. Scenario version 3
marks the changed trace/property contract, and the reusable qualification job
runs the standby lifecycle regressions before admitting full campaigns.

The initial scripted regression failed with `PromotionRequiresForce`; after
the fix it passed with exact replay and no leaks. Evidence is retained in
`/tmp/pr704-promotion-regression-red.log` and
`/tmp/pr704-promotion-regression-green.log`. New complete soaks must validate
the corrected revision; earlier successful shards are historical evidence.

The same revision's ordinary CI independently failed
`test_session_stage_transform_commit` with HTTP 503 (446 other tests passed).
Its retained server log contained no underlying error, and 30 unchanged-binary
native repetitions passed. The transaction helper now retains the response
body through its existing error checker; it does not retry commits or treat
503 as success. There is no evidence establishing a common cause with the
standby rejection or proving #723 resolves that transaction failure.

## 2026-09-14: producer readiness snapshot loss (#723)

[The Antfly E2E job on #723](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34801864332/job/103853126220)
ran `07bb51bdf0a063ad0f4782e35a48669b6c253f2c` and reported one failure,
445 passes, and five skips. The four previously investigated cases passed.
`test_embedding_producer_registry_rejects_orphans_and_owner_mismatches`
timed out requiring `enrichment_runtime.embed_batches_completed > 0`, despite
one indexed, query-visible document and complete durable source coverage.
Its aggregate readiness also reported `source_observation_incomplete` while
the individual shard reported complete publication without its source list.

The counter is scoped to the enrichment runtime, not durable completion.
Catalog descriptor changes can close/reopen an owner, and restart necessarily
replaces it. The exact CI replacement interleaving was not captured; the
unchanged executable passed 20 isolated repetitions locally. The test now
requires complete readiness for the configured artifact source and successful
semantic queries through both the producer index and its artifact consumer,
before and after a forced process restart. It does not require replaying
already-published artifacts just to increment a new runtime's counters.

The readiness contradiction has a deterministic production cause:
`runtime_status.cloneDBStats` omitted `DBIndexStats.source_replay`. That copy
runs when an ABI response is detached from its JSON parser and when the
control-plane cache publishes or returns a snapshot. Source names, replay
watermarks, repair facts, and observation counts now retain independent
ownership across these copies. The regression covers complete, lagging, and
failed sources, frees the original backing arena, destroys the intermediate
cache, and checks the retained result. Allocation-failure injection checks
partial-clone cleanup. It belongs to the existing runtime snapshot test family.

The same native reproduction exposed poisoned diagnostic labels (`0xaa` byte
arrays) after the ABI parser was freed. Enrichment phase/checkpoint/stall and
index repair/checkpoint labels now resolve to immutable labels, using the
owner enums where available and an explicit `unknown` for unsupported peer
values. This keeps native DBStats' borrowed-label contract and does not add
allocations to status merges.

Before the fix, the new unit regression reported **expected three sources,
found zero**; the strengthened E2E case timed out on the original executable
with `source_observation_incomplete`. Logs are
`/tmp/pr723-source-negative.log` and `/tmp/pr723-source-e2e-before.log`.
After merging `origin/main` at `3554f82101` (merge `19162ef60f`), the native
macOS arm64 Debug build passed all 49 steps and six focused owner/snapshot
checks. The binary SHA-256 is
`d7dce3ac5b091d32acad40c2b5fd99eb4a91b01b22c73dbc1a248dce90698eb2`.
It passed **100/100 repetitions of each of the five flake scenarios, 500/500
total**, with four regression workers and 25 iterations per worker. There
were no failed-case retries, skips, or timeout increases. The complete three
E2E modules passed **54 tests**, with only the existing opt-in million-chunk
scale case skipped, using four pytest workers and two process slots alongside
the soak.

Expanding validation to the snapshot/source-readiness family exposed two
pre-existing fixture inconsistencies: the lifecycle-continuity test expected
cached lifecycle to override an explicit `action_required` failure, and the
replay summary expected two LSM samples while providing only one. The former
now tests both ordinary continuity and authoritative failure; the latter
supplies both intended samples without relaxing the expected totals. Both
are included in the existing derived-coverage suite. All **114 checks** in
the expanded linked owner/snapshot/source-readiness run passed, including
allocation-failure injection, with no leaks. These last fixture-only changes
do not change the runtime code used by the soak. Temporary validation targets
were removed.

Evidence: `/tmp/pr723-merged-build.log`,
`/tmp/pr723-merged-soak-500.log`, `/tmp/pr723-merged-modules.log`, and
`/tmp/pr723-merged-snapshot-suite-fixed.log`. The initial expanded run is
retained at `/tmp/pr723-merged-snapshot-suite.log`. Linux validation remains
CI's responsibility; passing native soaks do not establish the precise
interleaving of the original CI counter reset.

### Snapshot review follow-up

A review of the same ABI copy path reproduced two further defects. After
replacing the source buffer, both table and index `last_merge_error` contained
`xxxxxxxxxxxx` instead of `InvalidChunk`. A snapshot with schema epoch 7,
catalog generation 8, and an enabled two-worker graph-metric runtime returned
zero/disabled defaults. The original reproductions are retained in
`/tmp/pr723-review-snapshot.log`.

Table and index merge error names, and the graph-metric runtime error name,
now contain their own bytes using the existing inline status-text convention
(256-byte identifiers; oversized JSON values are rejected). JSON remains a
string, or null for the optional graph-metric diagnostic. Copies, retained
artifact visibility, and aggregates need no new allocation or ownership
transfer. The C ABI's JSON projection retains the value too.

`LocalTableRuntimeStatus`, `DBStats`, and `DBIndexStats` cloning now preserve
value fields by default. A recursive compile-time pointer check requires an
explicit ownership override for pointer-bearing fields. Schema state labels
are re-interned through the catalog enum. This preserves columnar maintenance,
schema/catalog/row-format facts, visibility, and graph-metric runtime facts
without maintaining a second list of every counter.

The regression seeds scalar fields, compares the complete snapshot after an
ABI JSON round trip, destroys the response/parser and intermediate cache,
and checks diagnostic ownership through allocation-free copies and JSON
serialization. Allocation-failure injection also covers optional algebraic
candidate/progress diagnostics; their partial-clone cleanup is now complete.
All **111 snapshot checks** passed with no leaks, including existing
allocation-free commit checks (`/tmp/pr723-snapshot-focused-final.log`). The
repository's locked Ruff formatter and Python format check also pass; Black
is not the repository formatter.

The final linked Debug build passed **49/49 steps**, and the expanded
owner/snapshot/source-readiness suite passed **116 checks**, with no leaks.
The three affected E2E modules passed **54 tests** with the existing opt-in
scale case skipped. Evidence is in `/tmp/pr723-snapshot-fix-build-final.log`
and `/tmp/pr723-snapshot-fix-modules.log`. The native macOS arm64 executable
SHA-256 is `cfe5769abc4a2a3fe11dbc2fd1024e903da1449ff0f30409976126dd893be68a`.
Temporary validation target/root changes were removed.
The same executable passed **500/500 flake repetitions**, exactly 100 per
scenario, using four workers and 25 iterations each. The complete E2E modules
ran concurrently with the beginning of the soak; there were no failed-case
retries, skips in the soak, or timeout increases. The final soak evidence is
`/tmp/pr723-snapshot-fix-soak-500.log`. `origin/main` was fetched again and was
already included before this push. Linux validation remains CI's responsibility.

### Synthetic refresh preservation

The next review reproduced loss after a live → synthetic cache publication:
schema epoch 7, catalog generation 8, columnar passes 5, visibility hits 6,
and an enabled two-worker graph-metric runtime became zero/disabled, while
document counts survived (`/tmp/pr723-review-current.log`). The clone was
correct; the synthetic merge still restored only a list of selected fields.

The merge now retains the complete owned table stats from the cached owner,
then applies catalog index membership using the existing incarnation fences.
Fresh disk observations remain independent, and stale metadata cannot assert
latest-target completeness. It reuses the existing two clones and transfers
ownership without adding allocations. Both unused placeholder diagnostics
and removed cached indexes are freed by the retained temporary snapshot.

The transition regression also reproduced a second refresh erasing an idle
owner after its runtimes became disabled (`/tmp/pr723-synthetic-idle-negative.log`).
Preservation now recognizes the physical runtime-owner identity rather than
requiring nonzero workload counters. Root invalidation still discards it.

The existing snapshot family now covers all table values, heap-backed resolver
and index diagnostics after both source lifetimes end, index additions/removals,
repeated synthetic refreshes, live updates that decrease or clear counters,
same-root catalog fencing, replacement roots, and rejected delayed publications.
All **112 snapshot checks** pass, including allocation-failure injection and
existing allocation-free publication checks, with no leaks
(`/tmp/pr723-synthetic-fix-unit-final.log`). No test target or filter was added.

The final native macOS arm64 Debug build passed **37/37 steps**
(`/tmp/pr723-synthetic-fix-build-final.log`). Its executable SHA-256 is
`643f68bb54b5a5b0d6f1c29d6df19ed5d4401757eaacee2e412e162a6828f8cc`.
The same executable passed **54 E2E tests** (the existing opt-in scale case
skipped) across the three affected modules, and **500/500 flake repetitions**:
exactly 100 for each of the five scenarios, four workers and 25 iterations.
The modules ran concurrently with the start of the soak. There were no failed-case
retries, soak skips, or timeout increases. Evidence:
`/tmp/pr723-synthetic-fix-modules.log` and
`/tmp/pr723-synthetic-fix-soak-500.log`. The latest fetched `origin/main` was
already included. Linux validation remains CI's responsibility.

## 2026-09-13: overlapping storage owner E2E failures (#626, #722)

[PR #626's Antfly E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34781521711/job/103794277696)
ran merge revision `62181d9cbae16aa1599c7e4c9202fcabf9aa0dbc` and reported
**two failures, 444 passes, five skips** on Linux with Python 3.12.3:

- `test_artifact_coverage_terminal_outcomes_by_policy_after_restart` lost the
  partial-policy index's runtime observation after restart: zero reported
  groups, one missing group, `runtime_unavailable`, and `missing_group`. This
  matches the signature in both #722 CI attempts and the retained native
  reproduction described in [the E2E investigation](e2e/FLAKES.md).
- `test_stateful_external_embeddings_index_detail_supports_packed_ingest_and_query`
  failed its batch request with HTTP 500 `RuntimeBoundaryFailure`. The server
  first logged `IndexNotFound` in the `full_text_index_v0` derived worker at
  journal sequence 1, then an untransportable `StorageKernelFailure` from
  `commit_batch_with_cancellation`. This is an additional failure, distinct
  from #722's query callback returning an untransportable `StorageBusy`.

The #626 log is retained at `/tmp/pr626-job103794277696.log`. Repeated
`EmptyTargetedIndexObservation` messages precede the batch failure. They are
evidence to investigate, not proof that reconciliation caused it. The restart
signature's recurrence on another branch does not by itself establish its
introducing commit. The deterministic follow-up investigation is recorded
below on `codex/maintenance-e2e-fixes`.

The additional batch case belongs in the existing regression loop alongside
the three #722 cases; preserve the failing process roots and test the containing
`test_index_lifecycle.py` module as well, because CI shares that process between
tests. Do not retry committed writes or relax coverage/deadline assertions to
hide these failures.

The unchanged merged executable passed **100/100** isolated repetitions of the
additional packed-ingest case (four workers, 25 repetitions). Evidence is
`/tmp/pr626-local-packed-100.log`; this does not reproduce the shared-module
history or prove the worker is race-free.

The follow-up has established these defects with deterministic negative controls:

1. Warmup retired a resident owner installed by another operation. The linked
   owner regression expected one owner after delayed warmup and found zero.
   Transient cleanup now retires only the exact, still-leased owner it created,
   and preserves owners adopted by another operation. The same rule closes
   the release-then-retire race in transient reconciliation.
2. Compiled structural reconciliation returned its mutation result without
   appending an observation to the control-plane publication batch. An unchanged
   empty dense index reproduced eight `EmptyTargetedIndexObservation` retries
   and failed the existing five-second bound. Reconciliation now samples status
   under its exclusive owner lease and passes it through the existing root,
   catalog, and targeted-activation fences. A busy observation retains the group
   for another bounded quantum; it cannot acknowledge completion without facts.
3. Text publication planning reported an ordinary same-instance projection
   revision change as `IndexNotFound`. The regression changes an empty index's
   schema between capture and planning and failed at that exact check. Both
   JSON and parsed-document planning now refresh the context while holding the
   analysis lease used to construct the plan. Admission still revalidates it;
   delete/recreate replacement remains rejected. This explains a path from a
   legitimate schema refresh to a terminal derived-worker failure without
   treating every `IndexNotFound` as retryable.

`git blame` traces the warmup and compiled-reconciliation defects to
`332817c668f` ([#536](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/536)), and the
projection revision check to `aefe3bad405`
([#502](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/502)). Both are ancestors of
`c1a39a3aeb65e62d9e4494c5b785a028e4520c5d`, #722's unchanged base, so these
demonstrated defects predate #722 even though its base soak did not expose them.

Status collection also preserves independent sibling observations when another
group is cold or busy, probes only the requested group's owner, and retains
refresh debt when that probe is busy. `StorageBusy` and `StorageKernelFailure`
retain their semantic identities across the callback ABI; public query
contention is HTTP 503 rather than HTTP 500. Mutation retry semantics are
unchanged.

Negative-control logs: `/tmp/maintenance-owner-before.log`,
`/tmp/maintenance-owner-activation-before.log`, and
`/tmp/maintenance-text-before.log`. The warmup and activation fixes passed the
linked owner suite with no leaks. A fresh batch containing those two fixes
passed **100/100 per scenario, 400/400 total**, with the four unchanged E2E
tests and no retries or skips. Its executable SHA-256 is
`988f3c8414a168f76a1ffc9a75b79d94c8fd091e1555b9d209e657718dfaa010`;
output is `/tmp/maintenance-followup-e2e-100.log`. That executable predates the
text-planning and observation/error-transport changes; final validation of the
complete change set is recorded below. These deterministic defects and passing
soaks do not establish the precise interleaving of every original CI failure.

Final native Debug focused checks passed: the linked-owner suite (two tests),
text publication (two substantive tests plus two import checks), public query
availability (one table-driven test plus six import checks), the compiled
busy-owner refresh-debt regression, and all 12 stable runtime error ABI tests.
No leaks were reported. Temporary focused build steps used for the negative
controls were removed; the regressions remain in their existing owner suites.
The final binary SHA-256 is
`de2c5f7e99bb3074ed3238ed7e64f9b230387e949af6b0559b551ce1d6503519`.
All **54/54** tests in the three affected E2E modules passed using four pytest
workers and two process slots, preserving CI's shared-module fixture history.
Evidence: `/tmp/maintenance-complete-build-tests-final.log`,
`/tmp/maintenance-data-observation-tests.log`,
`/tmp/maintenance-error-abi-tests.log`, and `/tmp/maintenance-final-modules.log`.
The fresh final-binary batch passed **100/100 per scenario, 400/400 total**,
with four workers and no retries, failures, or skips. The log is
`/tmp/maintenance-final-e2e-100.log`; per-scenario counts and the executable
hash are recorded in `/tmp/maintenance-followup-validation.json`. These are
native macOS arm64 Debug results; Linux CI validation remains pending.

### Review follow-up: transient borrowing and activation assertions

Review of #723 found that an observational lease marked a transient owner as
adopted. A status probe overlapping warmup could therefore retain an idle DB
indefinitely. Residency now belongs explicitly to foreground admission or
retained background debt. Status and maintenance leases only borrow the owner;
transient cleanup records retirement and the final borrower closes it. New
observations cannot prolong pending retirement, while foreground admission can
adopt the same owner before the last borrower releases it. Prepared Raft writes
also adopt residency. Restore-marker reads use the same pinned retirement
protocol, eliminating their remaining release-then-retire-by-group path.

The linked owner suite exercises five deterministic lease histories: a status
probe finishing before warmup cleanup, a probe spanning cleanup, maintenance
spanning cleanup, foreground adoption, and prepared-Raft adoption. It also
checks that completed leases cannot retire a replacement owner. The activation
regression now requires a newer, fresh, target-complete publication for group
7001 and the expected dense-index generation/configuration hash, instead of
accepting an idle worker alone. These regressions run in the existing storage
owner aggregates.

Restoring observational adoption in a temporary negative-control build made
the new lease-history regression fail at `expect(!original.resident)`; the
other three checks passed, and no leaks were reported. The corrected source
was restored byte-for-byte. Evidence:
`/tmp/maintenance-review-negative-control.log`.

The restored revision passed **4/4** linked owner checks with no skips,
failures, or leaks (`/tmp/maintenance-review-owner-final.log`). A fresh soak
again passed **100/100 per scenario, 400/400 total**, with four workers and no
retries or skips (`/tmp/maintenance-review-e2e-100.log`). The three complete E2E
modules passed **54 tests**, with the opt-in million-chunk scale test skipped,
using four pytest workers and two process slots
(`/tmp/maintenance-review-modules.log`). Formatting and diff checks passed;
the temporary validation build step was removed.

The native macOS arm64 Debug binary SHA-256 is
`1bab589bbe0948595bdd213bec52f399f61b1f72fd24da1ee59999361c08de25`.
Per-scenario counts are in `/tmp/maintenance-followup-validation.json`.
Linux CI must validate this pushed revision independently.

## 2026-09-12: combined unit build/test budget terminates progressing DB-core (#716)

[The Linux unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34714680318/job/103609868433)
started its combined build/test step at 19:49:03 UTC, but DB-core execution only
started at 20:41:19. The hard watchdog terminated the step at 20:49:05 after
3,602 seconds. The remaining partition advanced from test 512 to 539 in the
last 45 seconds; the category partition had already passed. No assertion
failures or OOM kills were reported. The physical-usage tests and original
physical-churn benchmark passed, including both GC configurations.

Increase the combined hard limit from 60 to 90 minutes while preserving the
30-minute idle watchdog and 120-minute outer job limit. The build-tooling
contract tests check these defaults and their ordering. This gives cold builds
execution headroom; it does not establish that a future run will complete or
replace future work on phase-specific budgets and per-partition progress.

## 2026-09-12: physical-churn measurement races obsolete-file deletion (#503)

[PR #503's Linux unit job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34672950333/job/103497870209)
failed only `relational columnar production LSM physical churn benchmark` with
`FileNotFound`; its DB-core partition reported 1,140 passes, five skips, one
failure and no leaks. Build-budget checks passed and the cgroup recorded no OOM
kills. The original log does not identify the throwing filesystem call, and an
isolated unmodified local run passed both GC configurations.

The old size helper walked mutable active/obsolete inventories without a lock
or ownership lease and required every obsolete file to exist. Obsolete cleanup
intentionally unlinks off-lock before retiring its ledger entry, so even taking
the writer mutex around that helper would not make this contract sound.

The follow-up uses the backend-owned physical usage observer described in
[LSM version publication](../docs/design/lsm-version-publication.md#physical-usage-observation).
A deterministic storage hook forces capture, obsolete unlink, live-ledger
replacement and stat in that order. Separate checks preserve errors for missing
active files and denied I/O, force compaction while active SSTs are pinned, and
verify reclamation after the observer releases its pins. Tests also cover WAL
accounting, duplicate active/obsolete membership, overflow and allocation-failure
cleanup. This reproduces and closes the measurement race without claiming that
the original untraced CI failure proves the same throwing call.

Validation on the follow-up: the focused physical-usage, ledger-reclamation and
expired-obsolete cleanup suite passed 10 tests with one existing ReleaseFast-only
benchmark skipped and no leaks. The original production physical-churn test
passed three consecutive local runs (six GC scenarios: 0% and 50% per run).
These are native Debug correctness checks, not a throughput improvement claim.

```sh
cd zig
zig build lsm-backend-test -- --test-filter 'lsm physical usage' --test-filter 'ledger reclamation' --test-filter 'lsm backend removes expired obsolete'
zig build antfly-storage-db-test -- --test-filter 'relational columnar production LSM physical churn benchmark'
```

## 2026-09-11: main merge retains observation proofs for delayed notifications (#694)

Merging `aefe3bad4` exposed an interaction between the PR's redundant-notification
suppression and main's retained target-observation authority. A notification
for an already-observed source returned without recording a requirement. A
later snapshot marked pending could then erase the accepted observation.
Main's `accepted target observation survives late snapshots but not new commit
fences` regression failed on the initial merge at the settled group assertion.

The redundant-notification path now records the accepted source proof without
advancing the notification fence. The equivalent exact-index path also retains
its accepted proof. New targets and catalog fences still invalidate completion;
allocation failure retains the existing conservative invalidation behavior.
The merge keeps the PR's batched consistent coverage reads and main's pinned
snapshot regression, with packed-row-aware cardinality fallback.

Merged native Debug validation passed all 179 derived-coverage API tests,
92 DB coverage tests, and two packed-row/range-cardinality regressions, with
zero skips, failures, or leaks. The API suite ran with local listener access;
the initial sandboxed run also rejected two HTTP listener binds. SDK OAPI tests,
`make generate` (including `make build-antfarm`), `make fmt`, and whitespace
checks passed. Evidence uses `/private/tmp/ci694-main-merge-*`.

## 2026-09-11: last dense bulk-lease fixture races physical publication (#694)

While investigating [the Linux DB-core abort in run 34658598331](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34658598331/job/103457081854),
the complete local Linux Debug partitions exposed a separate assertion in
`db last external dense bulk lease finalizes covered rebuilding generations`.
The fixture failed in **10/10 full runs** on `17eed29b0`: two isolated containers
ran five repetitions each, one with the default allocator and one with
`MALLOC_PERTURB_=165` and the glibc tcache disabled. All ten runs passed the
watermark-reopen test that aborted in CI; their only failure was this assertion.

The fixture used best-effort online publication before creating a rebuilding
checkpoint and expecting the last external bulk lease to certify it immediately.
Online publication can leave the asynchronous physical checkpoint build pending.
Logical embedding coverage alone does not establish that publication boundary.
The fixture now calls `publishVectorBlockBasesAtStableTip` before introducing
the rebuilding checkpoint. Its immediate completion, clean status, generation
increment, and independent query-readiness assertions are preserved. Production
publication, scheduling, and timeout behavior are unchanged.

Local full-partition runs mount the repository read-only at `/workspace`, use
`/workspace/zig` as their working directory, and provide a writable `.zig-cache`.
This makes the split-replay and WebP fixture files available; the initial
reproduction's missing-file failures were harness errors.

The corrected fixture passed **100/100 native macOS Debug** and **100/100 Linux
x86_64 Debug** repetitions, with no failed-case retries. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/ci694-bulk-lease-fixed-native.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-bulk-lease-fixed-linux/results.json`.
The full Linux Debug DB-core run then passed both CI partitions: **1,116 passed,
eight skipped, zero failed, zero leaked**, exit 0 in 144 seconds. It used the
CI selection filters with the corrected fixture mounts and no allocator
instrumentation. Evidence: `/private/tmp/ci694-db-core-fixed-validation`.
`zig fmt --check` and `git diff --check` also passed.
Run the focused regression from `zig/`:

```sh
zig build antfly-storage-db-test -Doptimize=Debug -- \
  --test-filter 'db last external dense bulk lease finalizes covered rebuilding generations'
```

The original CI `munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer` abort remains unreproduced;
this fixture correction does not establish a fix for that memory error.
Before-fix evidence is retained in `/private/tmp/ci694-db-core-repeat-{1,2}`.

## 2026-09-11: forwarding-retirement native Debug soak passed (#694)

The executable built from `c11eead5aabe7027e4a84498bbd08489b580a89e`
passed **100/100 quickstart**, **100/100 three-by-three backup/restore**, and
**100/100 retry-exhaustion/restart**: 300 executions, zero failures, zero
failed-case retries, exit 0. Four workers each ran 25 repetitions of all three
scenarios. The native macOS Debug build completed 33/33 steps.

The run started at 20:53:06 UTC and finished at 21:34:31 UTC on September 11
(41m25s including the review pause). The four loop workers were paused during
the fresh PR review; their first quickstart executions finished normally, and
further iterations resumed after the review completed at 20:56:42 UTC.
Binary SHA-256:
`1b5262bc4d1246e9a77589d7f4d53984d19f71e065b36121acab2cb38f281386`.
Manifest, review record, combined worker output, and exit status are retained
under `/private/tmp/ci694-retirement-native-soak-c11eead5a`.

The subsequent main merge and release-test fix through `c1200f998` changed
container configuration, test code, and documentation, not the native runtime
sources exercised here. These results do not certify the container image or
resolve issue #705's separate progressive-index heap-corruption workload.

## 2026-09-11: release driver-discovery test depends on CI Python loader paths (#694)

SDK CI run `34645983534`, job `103416766382`, passed formatting and SDK
validation but failed release packaging in
`test_dlopen_finds_driver_in_injected_mount`. CI tested the merge with main's
`2bd96e33e` (#707). The test replaced `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with fixture directories
and then launched the toolcache Python, which exited 127. CI had supplied its
Python library directory through that same environment variable; the probe
therefore also depended on the interpreter's native-library installation.

The test now compiles a minimal native `dlopen`/`dlsym` probe and executes it
with only the mapped container paths. It checks the fake driver's return value
and verifies failure when those paths are removed. Loader errors are included
in assertion diagnostics. No GPU, host driver, inherited Python library path,
retry, or runtime-image workaround is needed.

Validation: both tests passed in a local Linux x86_64 container, including the
missing-path negative control. The macOS release suite passed (12 packaging
tests and 114 release tests, with the Linux-only probe skipped), as did
`make generate`, `make build-antfarm`, and `make fmt`; generation produced no
tracked changes. Logs: `/private/tmp/ci694-runtime-container-linux.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-release-mac-fixed.log`. This changes test code only; the
native Debug runtime soak built from `c11eead5a` continues independently.

## 2026-09-11: forwarding retirement admission and dense-finalization fixture (#694)

The forwarding review gap below is fixed by checking the native executor's
busy count under its scheduler mutex after acquiring a request lease. Admission
accounts for all still-busy tasks (including completed requests still retiring)
plus the full remaining grant of every active lease. Already-submitted work is
conservatively counted twice so an admission cannot consume another request's
unused grant. Insufficient capacity returns the existing pre-transport overload
classification. This constant-time check adds no retries, polling, task churn,
or workers; the 252-worker aggregate and dedicated Raft lane remain unchanged.
Borrowed schedulers retain their own admission contract.

A regression pauses real Threaded group-task destruction after group completion,
releases the request lease, and verifies that a supported six-slot forwarding
lane rejects new admission until physical capacity is available. It fails on
the old implementation with `TestUnexpectedResult`, then passes with the fix.
The production path does not wait for executor retirement.
Negative control: `/private/tmp/ci694-forward-finalization-negative.log`.

The Linux failure in `db dense finalization owner drains requests queued during
publication` used an online, best-effort publication attempt as if it established
a synchronous native-generation boundary. CI logged both finalization attempts
before the posting checkpoint finished installing. The fixture now explicitly
publishes at a stable tip before asserting certification and acquires the
finalization claim through the normal claim function. The queued-request and
clean-generation assertions remain intact. Production background publication
and deadlines are unchanged. The original fixture passed 100 local repetitions;
that does not invalidate the recorded Linux interleaving.

Native Debug validation passed the 62-test DB/backend selection and 67-test
runtime selection (including real forwarding under saturated control/Raft
executors), with zero skips, failures, or leaks. The two targeted regressions
passed 100 repetitions each, 200 executions total. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/ci694-capacity-finalization-final.log`,
`/private/tmp/ci694-capacity-data-final.log`,
`/private/tmp/ci694-capacity-finalization-repeat.log`, and
`/private/tmp/ci694-finalization-original-repeat.log`.
The initial runtime test attempt could not bind its listener inside the sandbox;
the same binary passed with local socket access. Fresh binary soak and CI
acceptance for this follow-up are recorded separately when complete.

## 2026-09-11: combined native Debug acceptance and remaining review gap (#694)

The Debug executable built from `cdc9ffcc8c4d0ed9020564427694173d80185629`
passed **100/100 quickstart**, **100/100 three-by-three backup/restore**, and
**100/100 retry-exhaustion/restart**, with zero failures or failed-case retries.
Four workers each ran 25 repetitions of all three scenarios. The run started
at 19:23:06 UTC and finished at 20:01:01 UTC on September 11 (37m55s), exit 0.
The build completed 33/33 steps. Binary SHA-256:
`b7ee84555588fffaf9aa5c9d6c59b580db2493cc7ab459b3361f07a84c73ce6a`.
Manifest, revision, counts, and combined worker output are retained under
`/private/tmp/ci694-coherent-native-soak-cdc9ffcc8`. These results cover the
prefetch and coherent-publication fixes above the earlier failed soak.
Issue #705's separate progressive-index heap corruption remains unresolved;
these scenarios do not reproduce or certify that workload.

Fresh review identified a remaining executor-capacity gap, separate from the
passed soak: request-forward leases count completed requests, whereas Zig
0.16 releases `Threaded.busy_count` after group completion and task destruction.
An allocator pause at that actual retirement edge deterministically leaves six
completed group tasks occupying all six slots of a supported forwarding lane;
the next submission returns `ConcurrencyUnavailable`. The production default's
two spare slots do not establish an ordering guarantee either. The reproduction
isolates the executor contract; it does not inject this pause into a live HTTP
forwarder. Source and output are retained at
`/private/tmp/ci694-forward-retirement-review.zig` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-forward-retirement-review.log`. Forwarding admission still
needs a capacity guarantee that includes executor retirement; the passing soak
must not be presented as resolving this review finding.

The latest Linux x86 job passed all five prefetch tests but failed
`db dense finalization owner drains requests queued during publication` with
`TestUnexpectedResult`. Its cause is not established by the passing native
soak. CI evidence: [job 103392541552](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34638056167/job/103392541552)
and `/private/tmp/ci694-cdc-x86-ci-full.log`.

## 2026-09-11: partial operational stats erase the published index inventory (#694)

The native Debug soak of `badafbaf9` finished with quickstart **97/100**, while
backup/restore and retry/restart each passed **100/100**. Two quickstart polls
lost the already-serving text index after creating the image index; another
returned zero source documents after the image searchable-artifact wait.
Evidence is retained under `/private/tmp/ci694-reservation-native-soak-badafbaf9`.

A diagnostic variant polled the existing index 100 times after releasing the
embedder. It reproduced the missing-runtime response twice in 20 runs. The
instrumented API received `source=live_writer_publish`, `docs=3`, `indexes=0`;
the immutable table read view had not been invalidated. See
`/private/tmp/ci694-api-diag-soak/tmp/antfly-zig-standalone-e2e-z3pie08a/server.log`
and the sibling failure `antfly-zig-standalone-e2e-0lvzz9hb`.

The runtime refresher first missed writer-cache admission, then acquired a
lease in its fallback probe. That fallback called `DB.stats()`, whose bounded
operational contract permits an empty index inventory while apply is busy.
Later overlays could refresh document counters without restoring those index
rows. Publishing this as a fresh writer observation let the complete refresh
replace the prior index inventory with an empty one.

The fallback now uses `runtimeStatusStatsConsistentIfAvailable`: only a
coherent observation receives writer authority. Contention falls through to
the retained cached observation, or an explicit synthetic placeholder if no
runtime has published yet. The cold startup publication path uses the same
boundary and returns retryable `WriterLocked` instead of manufacturing an
observed empty inventory. Neither path adds a blocking apply-lock acquisition,
a polling loop, or a longer public timeout.

The deterministic regression releases the writer-cache mutex between the two
probes while holding apply through the fallback observation. It fails on the
old code with `expected 1, found 0`, without leaks. With the fix it retains
source cardinality and the serving index, then observes a subsequent write.
The cold-publication regression covers opening, artifact rebuild, and startup
catch-up phases. Native Debug validation passed ten focused refresh/publication
tests and all 226 writer lifecycle regressions (236 total), without skips,
failures, or leaks; the combined build completed 17/17 steps. Logs:
`/private/tmp/ci694-status-fallback-before.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-status-fallback-fixed.log`.

## 2026-09-11: prefetch restart races executor capacity release (#694)

[CI run 34627106321](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34627106321/job/103355428154)
failed `prefetch queue background wake stop and restart preserve lock policy`
with `ConcurrencyUnavailable` on the second `startWorker`. The Zig 0.16
threaded executor wakes a future's awaiter before its worker decrements the
executor's busy count. Awaiting the old task therefore does not guarantee that
the queue's one-slot executor can admit its replacement. The recorded stack
lands on the capacity-limit check, not thread creation or allocation failure.

The queue now owns one task from first successful start through deinit.
Stop withdraws processing admission and waits for an in-flight callback to
quiesce; restart resumes the parked task. Deinit signals final shutdown,
awaits the task, and joins its executor before releasing ownership. Pending
items remain available for a later resume or manual drain. This avoids task
churn, capacity retries, and polling in production while preserving both
locked and unlocked callback policies.

The restart regression disables all new executor admission after the first
start, so the old resubmission design deterministically fails. A second
regression holds an unlocked callback across stop, verifies stop cannot return
early, and checks that queued work remains available for manual draining.
All five focused tests passed 100 consecutive native Debug repetitions
(500 test executions). The original implementation passed 100 native repeats;
those passes did not invalidate the failing Linux CI interleaving.

Run from `zig/`:

```sh
zig test pkg/inference/src/runtime/tier/prefetch.zig
```

Evidence: `/private/tmp/ci694-badafbaf9-x86-ci-full.log` and

in `/private/tmp/ci694-prefetch-original-regression.log`.

The native Debug soak of `badafbaf9` completed separately with quickstart
**97/100**, backup/restore **100/100**, and retry/restart **100/100**.
Two quickstart failures lost the existing text index's runtime observation
after image-index creation; one returned a zero image source cardinality after
the searchable-artifact wait. These motivated the coherent-publication
follow-up recorded above.

## 2026-09-11: fence stale expiry and reserve uncertain restore capacity (#694)

Review of `8a4d2d83e` added two deterministic failures in the isolated
`ci694-expiry-race-review` worktree. An old poll captured an uncached expired
record; re-admission retired it and committed a replacement with an unknown
receipt. Neither operation advanced the missing-record refresh revision, so
the old poll erased the new durable job. Separately, a full 64 MiB retained-byte
budget still admitted a durable create before the cache rejected it.
`/private/tmp/ci694-review-expiry-race-tests.log` records both failures,
with the 26 existing tests passing and no leaks.

Every attempted persistence mutation now invalidates older observations,
including unknown outcomes and absent cache entries. Point expiry proposes a
SHA-256 digest-conditional delete: Raft apply removes only the exact observed
record, so a delayed command cannot erase a changed or replacement job.
The wire command is gated on metadata protocol version 6; restore persistence
ABI version 4 carries the conditional callback and has no unsafe fallback.
The digest keeps the expiry command small without copying a 64 KiB record.

Admission reserves bytes and a job slot before proposing. Reservations remain
charged after an unknown outcome; a missing point read cannot release them.
Uncertain updates also reserve potential record growth. Cache adoption moves
the existing charge without double counting, while confirmed writes/deletes
resolve reservations. A newly fenced leadership preparation rebuilds accounting
from its linearizable durable view. Ordinary operations maintain this ledger
in constant time; there is no per-admission durable scan or added Raft round.

Regressions cover stale polling, replayed digest-conditional deletion across
key reuse, aggregate byte exhaustion before persistence, missing-row polling,
uncertain create recovery, and uncertain update growth. Run the restore-store,
metadata-logic, and restore HTTP targets in Debug. Historical soaks of
`0126d8b30` and `8a4d2d83e` do not validate these changes.

Native macOS Debug validation passed all 29 restore-store, 248 metadata-logic,
and 36 restore HTTP tests, with no skips, failures, or leaks. The store build
completed 14/14 steps and the combined metadata/HTTP build completed 17/17.
Evidence: `/private/tmp/ci694-reservation-store-tests.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-reservation-integration-tests.log`. Fresh E2E acceptance
requires rebuilding this revision and reaching 100/100 in each scenario.

## 2026-09-11: restore expiry must retire durable idempotency ownership (#694)

Fresh review of `0126d8b30` reproduced an expiry regression: after a terminal
job's seven-day retention period, a detail poll evicted only the local record.
Conditional admission then rediscovered the expired durable row, returned it
as accepted, and queued no work. The next detail poll returned not found.
The deterministic polled-expiry regression passed with main's restore-store
implementation (`c3bc001353`) and failed on the PR with
`expected .queued, found .succeeded`. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/ci694-review-expiry-base-focused.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-review-expiry-test.log`.

Expiry now confirms durable deletion under the store's leadership term before
releasing the cache and key reservation. Re-admission checks the requested key
even when bounded periodic pruning has not reached it. Conditional creation
also retires matching expired records left by older caches, then retries
creation once; it never accepts an expired record or deletes a different key
after a hash collision. Failed or uncertain deletion preserves cached ownership.
The ordinary admission path adds no extra persistence round.

Regressions cover polling, cached retry, and an uncached durable record across
successful deletion, failure before deletion, an unknown outcome after deletion,
and leadership loss. They verify a changed request can reuse an expired key and
creates exactly one durable job, history entry, and runnable item. Run
`zig build antfly-api-restore-jobs-test -Doptimize=Debug`.
Short-lived E2E soaks do not exercise the retention boundary.

Validation: **26 restore-store tests** (including the 12 fault combinations)
and **36 restore HTTP tests** passed in native Debug with no skips, failures,
or leaks. Both focused builds completed all 14 steps. Zig formatting and
`git diff --check` pass. Logs: `/private/tmp/ci694-expiry-fixed-tests.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-expiry-http-tests.log`.

## 2026-09-11: recoverable restore admission and bounded progress retirement (#694)

Review found a remaining admission gap: a Raft wait can time out before an
enqueue commits. Losing the generated identity invites a second independent
job. The `0259bab66` soak retained two jobs for the same request; the later
receipt fix addressed its leadership classification, but not the timeout path.

Every new restore has a recoverable idempotency key, including requests that
omit the header. Its principal/resource namespace and key determine the job ID.
A conditional-create Raft command atomically claims that ID; replays return the
existing record without overwriting running or terminal progress. Identity and
request fingerprints are checked before adopting it, including fail-closed
handling of truncated-ID collisions. Metadata decoder capability 5 gates this
command across all members; ordinary topology retains its existing minimum
version. Persistence ABI 3 rejects older adapters rather than emulating a
conditional create with a racy get/put pair.

Only confirmed admission returns 202. An uncertain response carries the job
location and recovery key and instructs clients to poll or retry with the same
key. A missing row does not prove non-admission. Clients must supply a stable
key before their first request to recover from losing the entire HTTP response.
Unconfirmed work never enters the local dispatch queue.

Retiring each range previously scanned all remaining progress for its table.
A derived `(metadata group, table, range, node)` index is now maintained in the
same transaction as primary progress. Completion visits only that range's node
entries and removes both namespaces while clearing the restore intent.
Derived-index version 3 rebuilds older stores once from primary rows. Snapshot
replacement removes these derived rows and their version marker; rollback and
upgrade also rebuild rather than trusting rows an older binary did not maintain.

Deterministic regressions cover unknown admission, recovery with an empty local
index, preservation of a running checkpoint, repeated conditional claims,
delayed incarnation reports, legacy index migration, and visiting exactly
three entries with 300 progress rows across 100 ranges. Final-revision soaks
remain required. This is separate from the progressive-index heap corruption
in #705.

Native macOS Debug validation passed 24 restore-store tests, 36 restore/API
integration tests, and 247 metadata tests (one existing opt-in skip), with no
failures or leaks. The native binary build passed all 41 steps. `make generate`,
`make build-antfarm`, `make fmt`, and the Go SDK suite passed. Generation used
an isolated Zig cache after the shared cache was missing `libcompiler_rt.a`;
socket-based tests ran outside the filesystem/network sandbox.

## 2026-09-11: admitted topology receipt loses leadership (#694)

The merged Linux soak on `0259bab66` failed its first backup iteration with a
public create returning an unknown-outcome 409. Metadata logged `NotLeader`
after admission. The retained uncompacted logs on all three replicas contain
the common term-1 prefix through index 73, a term-3 no-op at 74, and no table
create. The request had not survived the election; this was not a coverage
counter failure. The fixture correctly refused to replay an unknown outcome.

The receipt waiter previously classified a leader change as supersession before
observing the admitted entry's applied identity. It now keeps the existing
bounded, event-driven wait across leader changes. An applied matching term
proves success; an applied different term proves replacement; missing status
or term proof remains unknown. The deterministic stepdown regression failed
before the fix: expected `pending`, observed `superseded` (101 other metadata
checks passed, with no leaks).

Only a single atomic topology proposal promotes proven replacement into the
new `MetadataMutationNotApplied` outcome. Compound reconciliation/other mutation
callers retain ambiguity, because replacement of their last entry cannot prove
that earlier entries did not commit. Authenticated forwarding carries the
separate `not-applied-v1` response; it never mislabels an admitted command as
`not-proposed-v1`. Older clients do not recognize the new value and fail closed.
Metadata and data routing may retry the complete atomic operation with this
proof, retaining the existing absolute deadline, hop budget, and campaign
ownership. Public exhaustion preserves the distinct proof. Transport failures,
missing proof, wrong status codes, and unresolved outcomes remain non-replayable.
The runtime error detail is appended, preserving all existing ABI values.

Evidence: `/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-first-failure.tar.gz` (SHA-256
`8893cda56544fb8af67124724cd730cb42c56900b46c4bbcec23021d4ca1eda9`, verified
against the runner), `/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-raft-state.jsonl`, and
`/private/tmp/ci694-receipt-stepdown-regression-before.log`.
Initial validation passes 179 data-runtime tests, 104 metadata/routing tests,
and 10 ABI tests without failures or leaks. Final receipt-mapping and public
response validation, the corrected Linux build, and fresh 100-per-scenario
acceptance are pending. The failed `0259bab66` batch is diagnostic evidence,
not acceptance for this fix.

## 2026-09-11: mixed-version Raft rejection compatibility (#694)

A fresh review of `667e09a58` found that the new rejection correlation assumed
all followers echoed the rejected AppendEntries previous index. Released main
instead reports its own last index in both `log_index` and `reject_hint`, with
the same version-1 wire encoding. A new leader could therefore ignore every
rejection from a lagging older follower and never catch it up.

The deterministic regression fails before the fix (expected next index 2,
observed 5) and covers empty, lagging, and longer conflicting follower logs.
Legacy-shaped feedback now backs a probe toward the confirmed prefix. During
pipelined replication, ambiguous rejections coalesce into one heartbeat-paced
retry; an intervening forward acknowledgement cancels it. Confirmed progress
never regresses, message/byte limits remain intact, and pending snapshots retain
exclusive ownership. The wire format is unchanged. A burst of 32 legacy
rejections produces no immediate payload retransmissions; the next heartbeat
issues one bounded retry, or preserves the pipeline if progress has resumed.

Validation: all **403 Raft library tests passed**, including compacted-log
snapshot recovery and the two compatibility regressions. **100/100 stable
etcd differential seeds**, 48 actions each, matched with the fix. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/ci694-legacy-rejection-before.log`,
`/private/tmp/ci694-legacy-rejection-final-library.log`, and
`/private/tmp/ci694-legacy-rejection-stable-differential.log`.

The preceding merged revision also passed **1,477 integration tests** (one
existing opt-in external endpoint skip), **179 data-runtime tests**, and
**73 Python harness checks**, without failures or leaks. Fresh Linux acceptance
must use the compatibility fix; the pre-merge 300/300 below is historical.

## Peer endpoint changes bypass stable placement reconciliation (#694 review)

After merging `origin/main` (`444440574`) in `6b0985d09`, review found that
`DataRaftPlacementInputs` compared placement and split inputs but omitted
store Raft endpoints. A peer restart can change its URL without changing
membership or the local metadata counter. The stable path then returned before
publishing updated transport routes, indefinitely retaining the old endpoint.

The cache now owns and compares node IDs and Raft URLs alongside its existing
inputs. It deliberately excludes heartbeat generations, capacity, and health
telemetry. Unchanged inputs use an allocation-free linear comparison and retain
the admitted topology; a changed route is published through reconciliation.
Local placement changes still require linearizable metadata authority.

The deterministic production DataServer regression fails before the fix:
transport retains port 31001 when metadata advertises port 31002. It passes
after the fix and also verifies that heartbeat/capacity changes and repeated
unchanged observations retain the admitted plan. The merged data-runtime suite
passes **179/179**, without skips or leaks, and **73 Python harness checks**
pass. Evidence: `/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-peer-before.log`,
`/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-data-fixed-unrestricted.log`, and
`/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-python.log`. The initial sandboxed full suite
could not bind local HTTP listeners; its nine failures and two skips are
superseded by the unrestricted 179/179 run, not counted as acceptance.

The merge preserves all 34 regression build additions in main's new owner
modules. A fresh Linux build and 100-per-scenario soak are required for the
merged endpoint fix; the earlier 300/300 result below predates this merge.

## 2026-09-11: mixed Linux acceptance before the main merge (#694)

The fresh run completed **300/300**, with **100/100 each** for CLI quickstart,
three-by-three metadata backup/restore, and CLI retry exhaustion/restart.
Four workers each ran 25 iterations of all three scenarios, from 02:21:01 to
03:17:04 UTC. There were zero failures, errors, skips, or failed-case retries;
the driver exited 0. These results are from one revision and do not combine
passes from the earlier failed runs.

Production commit `05f96814e` includes the atomic coverage batch, lifecycle and
placement authority fixes, durable Raft replacement/abort fixes, and monotonic
replication progress. Test revision `b63468094` includes complete publication
before exact semantic ranking. The subsequent `574af3586` formatter correction
has an identical Python AST. The Linux x86_64 ReleaseFast executable was built
with a fresh compiler cache and verified SHA-256:
`dfdbe000a2712b11d0919a4dc66888c51f905030d3d14a8a360bee4d5cbc3265`.
The driver used eight allowed CPUs (`0-6,8`) on a pod requesting four CPUs and
limited to eight; these were not dedicated cores. The retry scenario retained
all 36 provider attempts and the real production backoff.

Complete logs, runner script, and machine-checked acceptance manifest are in
`/private/tmp/ci694-replication-acceptance-results.tar.gz`, SHA-256
`f78936d40adbf5f6b96519bdc3a8c871e96531b0f168a838192531326515a9cd`,
verified against the runner archive. Historical failure archives remain
preserved separately. This acceptance result does not establish that unrelated
flakes cannot occur; deterministic regressions and evidence limits are recorded
below. GitHub CI is tracked separately from this controlled Linux soak.

## Delayed Raft responses amplify replication and exhaust outbound admission (#694)

The `42cb81c6a` run ultimately finished **297/300**: quickstart 99/100,
backup/restore 98/100, retry exhaustion 100/100. The second restore failure
(`yiezk7ry`) retained completed progress on metadata node 1 while nodes 2 and 3
had retired it; node 2 logged up to 2,377 messages / 642,867,360 bytes in a Ready
batch. Both failures and the CLI failure below are preserved in
`/private/tmp/ci694-durable-complete-results.tar.gz`.

The fresh Linux mixed soak on `42cb81c6a` failed backup/restore in worker 1,
iteration 1. Metadata node 1 accumulated a Ready batch of **1,144,753,225 bytes**,
exceeding the unchanged 1,140,850,688-byte hard ceiling, and quarantined its
group. Earlier batches grew from hundreds of messages to thousands. The first
failure's logs, durable state, and native stacks are preserved in
`/private/tmp/ci694-durable-first-failure.tar.gz` (SHA-256
`70658edd776376a2c5dc2a966b59d6941b0ea9a37b3030200e8d7fe835350657`, verified
against the runner archive). This run is failed acceptance.

The leader assigned every success response directly to both `match_index` and
`next_index`, rewinding acknowledged progress and the optimistic send cursor.
A deterministic 32-entry pipeline reproduces the amplification: acknowledging
its first entry requeues the remaining **31 already-sent entries**
(`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-progress-before-focused.log`). Successes now preserve
monotonic Match and Next, while current empty-probe acknowledgements can still
resume replication. Rejections identify the rejected append's previous index
separately from the follower's last-index hint; delayed rejections cannot clear
a newer flight window or supersede a newer probe. Earlier-term acknowledgements
cannot authorize progress in a replacement leader's term.

A full window also needs recovery if an append or its acknowledgement is lost.
Heartbeat responses now allow a payload-free append probe at the last sent
prefix. Its acknowledgement releases the window; a valid rejection resumes
catch-up from the known matching prefix. Normal acknowledgements continue
unsent work even when another voter has already advanced commit. Message/byte
limits, outbound quarantine, and request deadlines are unchanged.

The same response-path review reproduced an older-term entry being committed
by counting replicas alone (`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-current-term-before.log`,
expected commit 1, observed 2). A quorum now directly commits only a current-term
entry, which commits its older prefix indirectly. The snapshot-abort harness
also now installs the acknowledged prefix before claiming the follower has it;
the old fixture invented a durable acknowledgement for absent data and relied
on Match regression to recover. Its corrected history matches the etcd 3.6.0
oracle (`/private/tmp/ci694-snapshot-abort-oracle.log`). All **401 Raft library
tests pass**, with no skips or leaks (`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-progress-fixed.log`).
All **176 data-runtime integration tests** also pass without skips or leaks
(`/private/tmp/ci694-replication-data-runtime.log`). The etcd comparison matches
**100/100 stable-profile seeds**, 48 actions each, with pre-vote and quorum
checking (`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-progress-stable-differential.log`). The broader
stress-profile comparison encounters an existing removed-voter visibility
difference at seed 3, step 25; the pre-fix revision reproduces it as well
(`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-stress-seed3-before-oracle.log`). This comparison is
not counted as passing acceptance. Repeated compaction actions now have the
same idempotent storage semantics in both harnesses. The fresh Linux
100-per-scenario acceptance above passes for this revision.

Isolated-cache validation of the complete Raft and data-runtime integration
targets passes **1,045 tests**, with one existing opt-in external wrong-route
endpoint check skipped (`/private/tmp/ci694-replication-fresh-integration.log`).
The optimized Linux build on `05f96814e` passed all 27 steps, using a fresh
compiler cache; executable SHA-256:
`dfdbe000a2712b11d0919a4dc66888c51f905030d3d14a8a360bee4d5cbc3265`.

## Exact semantic ranking requires complete source publication (#694)

Worker 4, iteration 23 of the `42cb81c6a` soak returned an empty semantic result
after `searchable-artifacts=1`, then indexed directly into the empty hit list.
The test expected Alpha to rank first across two source documents even though
that milestone guarantees only the first searchable artifact, not which source
has published. A controlled Linux probe holds Alpha's embedding while Beta is
published: the partial wait succeeds and returns only Beta; after releasing
Alpha and waiting for `complete`, Alpha ranks first and both documents appear
(`/private/tmp/ci694-partial-cli-probe.log`). This proves the ranking assumption
invalid; it does not independently reproduce the original empty result.

The quickstart retains its partial milestone assertion, then waits for the
existing `complete` milestone before asserting exact corpus ranking, matching
its image-query contract. The existing 20-second wait bound is unchanged, and
no query is retried to pass. A failed complete query now reports both wait
results, query output/stderr, and current index status instead of an unhelpful
IndexError. The original standalone log/root is retained in
`/private/tmp/ci694-durable-cli-failure.tar.gz`. Fresh acceptance includes this
test contract correction alongside the production replication fixes.

## Provider-restart regression races an independent index consumer (#694)

The x86 job in run `34543627560` failed
`db restart after provider failure resumes enrichment from retained async replay`
at an assertion that the derived consumer remained below the failed enrichment
source sequence. Production explicitly permits that consumer to advance while
enrichment remains behind; `truncateReplaySequenceAsync` retains replay through
the durable enrichment checkpoint. The test now stops at observed provider
failure, waits for the derived consumer to reach the source sequence, then
asserts retention and actual embedding/search recovery after reopening. This
exercises the adverse ordering directly instead of racing a negative progress
assertion. The three focused retention/restart tests pass with no skips or leaks
(`/private/tmp/ci694-replay-retention-fixed.log`). Original CI log:
`/private/tmp/ci694-26ff-x86-ci.log`.
The corrected restart test also passed **100/100 native macOS arm64 executions**
on `42cb81c6a`, using four workers with 25 fresh processes each and no retries
(`/private/tmp/ci694-replay-unit-soak/results.json` and `manifest.json`).

## Leadership replacement skips persistence and loses a confirmed abort outcome (#694)

The `9e5b558ce` Linux soak completed **299/300**: quickstart 100/100,
backup/restore 99/100, retry exhaustion 100/100. Its seed failure is preserved in
`/private/tmp/ci694-authority-complete-results.tar.gz` (SHA-256
`5be3b103ec4dc4d07a6abc5779c7bac5131496c16120f84c98923679d1396881`).
Decoded Raft records for group `8476403407145147734` show node 4 persisting a
term-2 prepare at index 4, then leadership changing to node 6 in term 3. Nodes 5
and 6 retain a term-3 no-op at index 4; node 4's final checkpoint incorrectly
retains the old term-2 prepare. All three transaction records are aborted.
The read-only decoder and output source are `/private/tmp/ci694-decode-raft.py`
and `/private/tmp/ci694-seed-failure-state.tsv`.

`RaftLog` replaced conflicting entries without moving back its stable/persisting
watermarks. Ready therefore omitted a replacement at a previously durable index,
allowing memory and restart history to disagree. The deterministic regression
fails before the fix with expected first unstable index 2, observed 3
(`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-replacement-before.log`). Replacement now invalidates
both watermarks from the conflict; persistence completions require matching
index and term. Borrowed append clones before changing the old suffix so an
allocation failure cannot leave partial mutation. Duplicate appends preserve
matching entries and acknowledge only the supplied prefix; committed conflicts
remain errors. Regressions cover stale/in-flight completions, apply fencing,
matching prefixes, and persistence/restart in both storage modes.

The superseded prepare also exposed a transaction outcome error. After the
coordinator confirms its durable abort, a prepare's unknown Raft/transport outcome
does not make the transaction decision unknown. These failures now return the
existing participant-unavailable conflict only after `abortParticipants`
confirms abort; an unconfirmed abort still propagates `AbortDecisionNotDurable`.
The existing bounded stateless retry owner may then create a fresh transaction.
No prepare is replayed blindly, and commit ambiguity remains conservative. The
coordinator regression failed with `RaftBatchWriteOutcomeUnknown` before the fix
(`/private/tmp/ci694-prepare-abort-before.log`); it covers direct abort success,
abort confirmation through status, and pending/committed decisions that cannot
authorize a fresh attempt. Production retry limits and deadlines are unchanged.

Validation: all 395 Raft library tests, 19 transaction coordinator/participant
contracts, four existing stateless retry-bound contracts, and 176 data-runtime
tests pass without skips or leaks. Logs: `/private/tmp/ci694-raft-final.log`,
`/private/tmp/ci694-transaction-contracts-fixed.log`,
`/private/tmp/ci694-abort-retry-contracts.log`, and
`/private/tmp/ci694-raft-replacement-data-runtime.log`. Fresh Linux acceptance
remains required for this combined revision.

## Review follow-up: forwarding capacity and equal placement counters (#694)

Review reproduced two independent defects on `9e5b558ce`. Saturating the shared
32-worker outbound executor prevented an actual Raft HTTP request from starting
with `ConcurrencyUnavailable` (`/private/tmp/ci694-review-outbound-capacity.log`).
Forwarded application writes now acquire a lease on their own bounded executor
before transport admission. Each lease reserves six workers for the nested
HTTP/1 request, connect, socket, and deadline tasks; the default 32-worker lane
admits five simultaneous forwards. Excess requests report the existing safe
leader-unavailable classification before sending. Teardown closes admission and
drains leases before destroying the executor. Borrowed I/O remains authoritative.
The default API allocation changes from 48 to 16 workers to fund the new lane;
the aggregate remains 252 under the existing 256-worker ceiling. A regression
proves both forwarding under Raft/control saturation and Raft HTTP progress under
forwarding saturation. Capacity and shutdown tests cover rejection and draining.

The second regression supplied changed placement with the same peer-local epoch
as the admitted plan. Before the fix, observation reconciliation succeeded
instead of requiring authority (`/private/tmp/ci694-review-epoch-collision.log`).
The stable path now compares owned placement inputs by value: metadata identity,
all local and remote placement rows, and split destination IDs. Equal counters
cannot bypass authority for a changed local plan. Unrelated status/counter changes
reuse the admitted plan without allocation, topology reconstruction, or a quorum
read. This retains one copy of placement inputs and performs an exact linear
comparison; changed inputs rebuild the candidate plan before deciding whether
fresh authority is required. Regressions cover equal-counter replacement/removal,
unchanged placement with a different counter, and authoritative deletion.

All 176 data-runtime tests and 62 backend-runtime/capacity tests pass with no
skips or leaks (`/private/tmp/ci694-review-fixes-data-runtime.log` and
`/private/tmp/ci694-review-fixes-lane-lifecycle.log`). Fresh Linux acceptance is
required. The prior `9e5b558ce` soak finished 299/300; the subsequent durable-log
and transaction-decision investigation is recorded above. Bounded prepare/apply
outcome diagnostics retain the relevant phase without changing deadlines.

## Metadata cache incorrectly orders peer-local lifecycle counters (#694)

Ordinary metadata cache refresh compared `AdminSnapshot.status.metadata_epoch`
numerically across peers. Those lifecycle counters are process-local: an old
empty catalog at counter 1000 could suppress a newly created table returned by
another peer at counter 1 indefinitely. The regression failed before the fix
with expected one table, observed zero (`/private/tmp/ci694-observation-before.log`).

Observation publication now uses the existing snapshot fence generation and
mutation-invalidation rules, without ordering peer-local counters. A concurrent
linearizable publication still supersedes an older in-flight observation; a
mutation invalidation still rejects it when no replacement exists. The cache
publication helper owns and releases its incoming snapshot on every path.
Changed placement and retirement retain their separate authority requirements.
The new regression exercises refresh, concurrent fence publication, invalidation,
and ownership cleanup, and is included in the default data-runtime test lane.
All 11 metadata-source checks pass without skips or leaks
(`/private/tmp/ci694-observation-fixed.log`).

## Follower catalog observations can retire live data-Raft history (#694)

The failed `00dd1e4aef` restore case (`sjng4qip`) recorded repeated admission of
both original and restored groups before `ConflictingDataApplyBatch`. Its
preserved restored Raft stores contained fresh bootstrap checkpoints while the
data apply journal retained committed identities. Data-Raft reconciliation was
allowed to retire local groups from ordinary cached/follower snapshots, and
`metadata_epoch` is only a process-local lifecycle counter. A stale peer can
therefore omit a live group while presenting a numerically larger epoch.

The real data-runtime regression admits group 77, then supplies an older empty
catalog with a larger lifecycle counter. Before the fix it fails with expected
`active`, observed `absent` (`/private/tmp/ci694-retirement-before.log`). Remote
reconciliation now requires a coherent linearizable snapshot before changing
local replica placement, membership, or generation. The authority read and
publication share the reconciliation mutex; the Raft progress owner remains
independent. Unsupported or unavailable authority cannot authorize retirement.
The status reporter also uses the refreshed snapshot after reconciliation.

Unchanged placement reuses its prior admitted plan without a quorum read.
Exact value comparison covers replica/bootstrap identity, voter/learner arrays,
and scalar relocation fields. A fresh authoritative snapshot bypasses the
process-local epoch shortcut so a real deletion still applies when two peers'
counters happen to match. The regression covers stale removal, stale generation
replacement, unchanged cached progress, and authoritative deletion with an
equal counter. All 175 data-runtime checks pass without skips or leaks
(`/private/tmp/ci694-retirement-runtime-final.log`). Linux acceptance remains
pending; the strict apply-history conflict check is unchanged.

## Metadata request waiters advance election time outside the cadence driver (#694)

The 60-case diagnostic backup run on `00dd1e4aef` recorded 6,665 metadata
Raft ticks (666.5 seconds of virtual time) during a short-lived fixture. Ready
messages grew past the 1 GiB hard ceiling and quarantined the metadata group.
Mutation, lifecycle, and CDC lease waiters still called tick-bearing Raft rounds
at their 1 ms polling interval; the dedicated 100 ms cadence driver was therefore
not the sole clock owner. These waits now drain pending/inbound/Ready work using
the existing progress-only API. Explicit cadence and combined driver entry
points retain their ticks. Lease-acquisition helpers no longer execute unrelated
control rounds while waiting for their own proposal.

The HTTP regression covers pending replica synchronization, lease acquisition,
table deletion, CDC lease progress, and lifecycle progress after an explicit
single-node election. Each helper must make progress without moving virtual
Raft time. The old sync path failed with expected 2000 ms, observed 2100 ms
(`/private/tmp/ci694-cadence-before.log`). All 80 metadata service checks pass
without skips or leaks (`/private/tmp/ci694-cadence-fixed-final.log`). The outbound
ceiling remains unchanged;
Linux soak validation is still required before attributing every remaining
consensus failure to this defect.

## Cold repair completion evicts its newly resident writer (#694)

The `00dd1e4aef` Linux mixed soak passed 294/300; quickstart failed once
immediately after restart with `StorageReadTemporarilyUnavailable` during RAG.
Cold repair selected the normal writer cache and completed repair, but its
completion cleanup tested whether a writer existed at entry rather than the
actual admitted owner. It retired the newly installed serving DB under a
read-compatible operation and published completion with no resident writer.
Completion now uses `managed_owner_is_live_writer`, preserving both preexisting
and newly promoted resident writers. Isolated restore owners still retire.
The structural-repair regression forces every quantum through cold admission
and immediately leases the resident DB after completion. It failed before the
fix with `ResidentDbRetryRequired`; all 222 lifecycle checks passed after the
fix without skips or leaks (`/private/tmp/ci694-owner-lifecycle-final.log`).

## CDC scheduling authority loss and backup ambiguity transport (#694)

The same soak terminated a metadata follower with `NotLeader`. CDC scheduling
acquired its reconcile lease outside the control round's authority-error policy.
Expected authority loss now defers scheduling before any CDC work is enqueued;
the next tick rereads the lease. Corruption still propagates. The focused
regression verifies no enqueue on leadership/proposal/ambiguous lease outcomes,
then successful scheduling after recovery (1/1 passed).

A separate backup timeout logged an untransportable `BackupOutcomeAmbiguous`.
That outcome must reach the coordinator intact: only this classification
prevents rollback of work whose remote completion is unknown. Append its stable
runtime ABI detail and preserve its conflict class. The regression failed with
an internal classification before the fix; all 10 error-ABI tests pass afterward.
Neither change extends deadlines or authorizes retry of an ambiguous mutation.

## Backup repository lifetime and usable bounded native diagnostics (#694)

One 3x3 case completed its assertions but failed deleting its temporary backup
repository while the running cluster's reclaimer created
`.antfly-backup-reclaim-cursor.publish.lock`. The repository now lives below the
cluster fixture root and is removed only after every process stops. This also
preserves repository evidence on failure. DELETE failures include their response
body so a future conflict is attributable.

Default GDB symbol loading exhausted the 10-second capture budget on the 520 MB
release executable. `--readnever -q -nx` retains minimal symbols/native unwinding;
timeouts retain partial output. A live Linux attach completed in 0.29 seconds
with thread stacks. All 73 Python harness checks and pinned Ruff checks passed.
Fatal data apply conflicts now emit bounded group/index/term/type/digest evidence
without document payloads; the conflict guard remains strict.

These fixes are not full acceptance. The 100-per-scenario soak remains
99/100 quickstart, 95/100 backup/restore, 100/100 retry exhaustion. A subsequent
60-case diagnostic backup run on the old runtime passed 57/60 and exposed
metadata authority loss, outbound Ready growth/quarantine, and an ambiguous seed
write. The restore apply conflict and remaining request/consensus progress
failures are still being investigated. See `e2e/FLAKES.md` for artifact paths.

## Dense reset fixture bypasses the catalog lifetime barrier (#694)

[Run 34520726158, job 103018251656](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34520726158/job/103018251656?pr=694)
aborted on Linux x86_64 at `00dd1e4aef` during
`db chunked dense enrichment replays cached artifacts after dense reset without re-embedding`.
The native publication worker crashed retaining an HBC posting generation through
`denseProjectionCheckpointMetadata`; the unit process exited with code 134.

The fixture directly closed and reopened the dense index through
`IndexManager.resetDenseIndexForArtifactRebuild`, bypassing DB structural
admission. `runUntilIdle` drains replay but does not stop the independently owned
native publisher. That publisher pins the catalog without holding the apply
lock, so an unguarded reset can poison the HBC while it is still being read.

All three fixture callers now use a DB helper that acquires the existing
structural catalog barrier before apply exclusive. The low-level reset asserts
that catalog admission is closed and readers are drained. The original tests
retain their background workers and cached-artifact/re-embedding assertions.
A deterministic regression holds the same catalog pin as native publication,
verifies reset closes admission without completing, then releases the pin and
checks reset completes and admission reopens. Before the fix, reset completed
without the barrier and the regression failed with `TestUnexpectedResult`.
The regression and all three affected fixtures are included in the focused dense
lifecycle suite.

With the fix, all 81 focused dense lifecycle checks passed on macOS ARM64 without
skips or leaks. A separate 25-iteration run of the four reset regressions passed
100/100 test executions, with the original fixtures' background workers enabled.
Logs: `/private/tmp/pr694-reset-before.log`, `/private/tmp/pr694-reset-after.log`,
`/private/tmp/pr694-reset-soak.log`, and `/private/tmp/pr694-reset-dense-suite.log`.
The failing CI run is Linux evidence; these local passes do not replace the
Linux rerun of the fixed commit.

`index get` reported complete readiness. A subsequent `index list` retained
the thumbnail index's target/published revision 6 and all three coverage
outcomes, but regressed `source_coverage.observation_complete` to false.
The same job also failed the backup seed batch with HTTP 409, the forwarding
failure described below. The serverless filesystem GET regression did not
recur, and the Autograph case passed.

The runtime owner can sample an accepted source target before that write's
deferred publication callback reaches the status cache. The cache previously
deduplicated callbacks only against earlier notifications. With no notification
watermark yet, even an already-observed revision minted a new observation
fence and revoked completion. A deterministic cache regression reproduces
this ordering without sleeps: publish complete target 6, deliver notifications
for 6 and 5, and inspect both list and detail snapshots.

The cache now also recognizes a completed observation of the notified source
revision in the current table epoch. Each accepted group publication records
its cache epoch; a retained snapshot from before a catalog fence cannot
acknowledge a notification in the new epoch. Newer source revisions,
unsequenced structural invalidations, and owner retirement still fence
completion. Cached and synthetic publications cannot establish this proof.
A separate regression checks the same revision across a catalog fence,
including republishing retained facts in the new epoch. No readiness
assertions or production deadlines were relaxed.

The ordering regression fails before the fix. With the fix, all 173
`antfly-api-derived-coverage-test` tests pass on macOS ARM64 without leaks.
Nine focused publication-fence and owner-lifecycle tests also passed.

The Linux CI executable from `3ab5f6aba` still reproduced this signature in
1/30 CLI runs. The exact-index notification path independently had the same
ordering gap. A second deterministic regression publishes source/index target
6 with applied sequence 6, then delivers that index's target-6 callback. It
reproduces the false list/detail observation even after the group-level fix.
Exact-index callbacks now preserve completion only when an authoritative
observation in the current epoch has both observed and applied the target.
They still record the source and reducing watermarks, preserving deletion
authority for future merges; a newer target still fences completion.
All 174 derived-coverage tests passed before merging the native storage
implementation, including callback permutations and deletion/replacement cases.
Retry exhaustion now has its own independently seeded CLI E2E test, retaining
the production backoff and degraded/restart assertions. The quickstart keeps
its readiness, maintenance-cycle, query, and restart checks and takes about
13 seconds instead of 77 seconds in the first Linux split validation.
Linux reproduction and soak results are recorded in the
[E2E history](e2e/FLAKES.md#completed-cli-readiness-regresses-after-publication-696).

## Coverage reads straddle the first atomic outcome commit (#694)

The `70e0b11869` Linux soak failed the retry test's initial healthy seed once,
before provider failures were enabled. The derived worker reported
`InvalidDerivedCoverageCounter` at `target_advance`. Later diagnostics showed
one posting boundary at 4 and the shared vector generation at 5, leaving
initial readiness pending. The shared base contained two artifact families;
its total count of two is not evidence of duplicate vectors in either index.

The producer commits produced/skipped/terminal-failed counters atomically, but
target validation read each key through a separate latest-value lookup. A
first commit between those reads can return a missing first counter and present
later counters, manufacturing a partial tuple that fails the worker. Outcome
transitions and source deletion can similarly mix incompatible cardinalities.

Target validation, repair certification, query admission, and status tuple
reads now capture a consistent batch of five keys: all three outcomes, the
range-local source count, and the legacy artifact counter. The LSM backend
captures mutable hits and pins the immutable source layout under its short
backend lock, then performs any disk reads outside it. An explicit capability
keeps backends with only per-key probe reads on their ordinary snapshot path.
General MVCC snapshots can clone the mutable table; they are not used on the
normal LSM counter path. Single-counter reads retain their existing point
probes. Legacy missing range counters retain their scan fallback, re-reading
the whole proof in one snapshot. Persisted partial tuples and counter overflow
remain errors, and current-generation outcomes still supersede an invalid
legacy artifact counter when that fallback is not needed.

The regression fails with `InvalidDerivedCoverageCounter` when the old read
behavior is restored in an isolated worktree. The fixed reader captures the
whole batch before a forced commit: that call observes the old empty state and
the next sees the complete new state. Removing a persisted counter still
errors. A storage regression retains captured values across overwrites,
deletions, and insertion of a previously missing key and verifies zero mutable
snapshot clones. The focused dense lifecycle suite passes 77 checks without
skips or leaks; the storage suite passes 737 checks with one intentionally
inactive cross-process child helper skipped and no failures or leaks. Its
standalone build target also declares the PDF dependency already required by
the shared background runtime. The posting/vector lag is an observed
consequence, not independent proof that every native publication stall has
this cause. The final mixed Linux acceptance above includes this coverage fix
and passes all 100 runs of each scenario.

## Online vector-publication test counts unrelated posting progress (#694)

The dense lifecycle suite intermittently expected zero progress from a second
online vector-publication call but received one. A previously queued posting
checkpoint completed between calls; the API's aggregate count includes that
valid handoff. The test now compares the exact-vector manifest generation and
its storage sync count, retaining the primary-scan hook assertion. Foreground
and posting-mutation admission must still remain open inside vector staging.
This tests the no-rebuild contract directly without assuming checkpoint timing.
The corrected combined run passed all 77 dense lifecycle checks and 737 storage
checks (one inactive child helper skipped), with no failures or leaks.

## Partial-source replay and stale follower restore-job observations (#694)

The `70e0b11869` Linux soak also reproduced an independently seeded retry case
with one covered, one terminal-failed, and one pending source. The healthy native
generation contained one searchable vector, but its replay watermark remained at
5 behind target 12. The target-proof callback required every source to have a
terminal outcome, even for replay records that could not produce an embedding.
It repeatedly logged an unavailable artifact counter and prevented projection
publication while the test deliberately held the later provider request.

Replay now distinguishes the count of materialized embeddings from completion
of all source work. Generation-scoped outcome tuples still fence the cardinality,
and replay must prove there are no unapplied applicable artifact records.
Already-clean projection maintenance uses that materialized target; initial
build, rebuilding-checkpoint finalization, and shadow cutover retain the strict
all-sources proof. The regression leaves a real source pending, verifies that
strict coverage remains unavailable, and permits advancing the certified index
across its source-only replay tail. Existing overflow, incomplete-coverage, and
same-name-generation tests retain their fail-closed behavior.

A separate restore poll timed out after 120 seconds because job-detail GETs could
serve a present but stale follower row. Decoding the retained native SSTs with
the production table decoder showed job `4153919785164652446` succeeded on
metadata-1 and metadata-3 at `1789063384173` ms, **15.403 seconds** after creation.
Metadata-2 retained its running attempt-1 state at `1789063369536` ms. Public
job-detail reads now require leader authority, matching list and mutation
operations, and persistence reads require a linearizable fence. A follower with
an existing row returns the retryable metadata-not-leader response instead of
hiding a completed job. The regression covers both absent and present follower
rows. This fixes the stale-read contract; the captured SSTs alone do not explain
the follower's replication lag.

The focused runs passed 76 dense lifecycle checks and the metadata server
regression without leaks. Fixed Linux acceptance remains pending; neither the
failed baseline nor partial counts are accepted as 100/100.

## Slow Raft sync kills the runtime; targeted activation joins sibling work (#694)

The Linux soak of `70e0b11869` exposed two additional signatures, separate from
late source notification and catalog-admission coverage lag. A quickstart
could see the new thumbnail incarnation in the catalog without any owning-group
runtime observation within its five-second activation deadline. Two retained
standalone logs showed structural reconciliation pending during dense projection
finalization. The cached-writer path started its replacement enrichment runtime
before catalog mutation, forcing a second cancellation/join; target reconciliation
also synced every index, including unrelated storage maintenance.

Cached-writer reconciliation now installs the replacement producer paused,
reconciles durable index admission, then starts it and publishes the matching
configuration fingerprint. Targeted reconciliation syncs only its installed
index; deletion does not sync surviving siblings. The lifecycle regression
checks the paused admission boundary, and another regression holds a sibling's
actual LSM storage lock while creating and dropping the target index.

Two metadata processes exited with `RaftProgressDriverStalled` after successful
WAL syncs of 6.315 and 6.495 seconds. The five-second progress watchdog was used
both for readiness and terminal supervision. Supervision now observes only
actual source errors; elapsed round duration continues to make readiness false.
Its failure-event wait retains the full control cadence, preventing a hot loop
while a round is stalled. Both metadata and data runtimes use this separation.
No durability acknowledgement moves ahead of sync. Raft's existing
`async_storage_writes` flag still calls the persistence hook inline, so enabling
that flag alone would not remove the I/O wait.

A deterministic blocked-round regression verifies unhealthy readiness, continued
nonfatal supervision with a real timed wait, and readiness recovery on the same
driver after release. Actual source errors still fail immediately. The focused
Raft run passed all 12 checks; the final activation lifecycle run passed all
222 checks, including both new regressions, without leaks. Fixed Linux acceptance
is pending. Backup failure teardown now captures bounded native thread stacks
through the existing opt-in disposable-child launcher; the shared helper is also
used by scaling tests. All 71 affected Python harness checks passed, and debugger
attachment was verified in the Linux runner without changing host ptrace policy.

The same diagnostic soak also recorded a seed batch with unknown write outcome
and contended Raft state, a restore job remaining nonterminal for 120 seconds,
and a partial-coverage index whose replay target stalled while a later source
was pending. Their cluster states and logs are retained separately; these
changes do not yet establish that those causes are resolved. Failed soak executions
remain baseline evidence and are not included in final acceptance counts.

## Initial catalog admission quarantines a healthy generation on shadow coverage lag (#694)

Splitting CLI retry exhaustion from the quickstart exposed an additional
availability failure on the native-storage merge. The separately seeded retry
test retained one covered image, one terminal source failure, and one pending
image, but reported `pending` / `queryable=false` instead of
`queryable_partial`. Three of four independent Linux executions failed; the
combined quickstart/retry execution passed. These exploratory results are not
part of final acceptance.

The retained `index_repair.checkpoint` bound the failure to the thumbnail's
catalog-admission initial build: trigger 10, work class 2, terminal phase 10,
`RepairSourceCoverageIncomplete`, with an inactive shadow and no activated
pointer. The generic repair error classification treated an incomplete shadow
as permanent failure for catalog admission even though the existing canonical
generation had a certified publication. It already treated this condition as
recoverable for replacement/artifact repair.

Catalog admission now uses the same recoverable coverage classification for
both new failures and terminal checkpoints persisted by older binaries. The
owner can discard only its inactive incomplete candidate and resume normal
convergence; structurally invalid generations remain gated. Initial admission
does not re-arm terminal provider outcomes. A durable-state regression failed
before this change and passes after it, proving recovery to a searchable
canonical generation and retirement of completed admission debt. All 75 dense
lifecycle checks passed without leaks. Linux validation is pending the rebuilt
executable.

## Restore completion owns progress retirement (#694)

The original Linux baseline also exposed a completed restore whose progress
did not disappear within 30 seconds. Inspection of retained metadata copies
showed two replicas with cleared intents/progress and a third with the earlier
restore state. That observation does not independently establish why the third
replica lagged. A subsequent `3ab5f6aba` Linux soak passed all 30 backup cases.

Apply-time review found a separate lifecycle gap: completing a restore cleared
the intent but left progress retirement to data-node refreshes. A delayed
progress command could recreate a completed restore's row or overwrite a
replacement restore's progress. Progress-only updates do not advance the
catalog epoch, so catalog refresh is not a reliable cleanup trigger.

Metadata now retires a range's progress in the same transaction that completes
its exact restore intent. Cleanup is scoped to that table and range and does
not depend on the reporting node remaining alive. Progress upserts validate
the active table/range and full reported restore identity at apply time.
The completion command also declares its restore-progress snapshot projection.
Legacy removal commands contain no restore incarnation, so they may retire
only orphaned progress; they cannot delete an active replacement's observation.

A committed-entry regression fails before the fix with `expected 0, found 1`
after completion. It verifies atomic retirement, delayed-report rejection,
replacement identity, stale completion/removal, and preservation of a sibling range.
All 80 metadata storage tests passed, followed by the strengthened sibling
regression. Backup failure diagnostics now retain per-replica restore state
and preserve request-timeout details without retrying ambiguous requests.

## Metadata mutation discovery exhausts admission time (#694)

The first forwarding-fix soak passed 59/60 backup runs. The remaining run never
reached a write: five explicit pre-admission `503 metadata_leader_unavailable`
responses exhausted the existing 30-second create budget.

Two concrete discovery defects were reproduced:

- A status GET used the entire five-second mutation budget. A stalled first
  endpoint prevented discovery from reaching a healthy configured leader, and
  each public retry started over at that same endpoint. Discovery now divides
  remaining time among the remaining probes and reserves a share for mutation
  delivery. The initial endpoint preference is captured once, so concurrent
  affinity updates cannot skip endpoints. Discovery still consumes no forwarding
  hops; delivered mutations retain the original hop, campaign, deadline, and
  ambiguity rules.
- `MetadataHttpClient.fetchStatus` returned a role string borrowed from an HTTP
  body it had already freed. Leader discovery could read corrupted bytes and
  classify the leader as a follower. Role stabilization now occurs inside the
  HTTP client before releasing either response or parser memory. Recognized
  roles use static strings, unknown roles become `unknown`, and temporary parser
  allocations (including escaped JSON strings) are released.

The virtual-clock regression fails before the probe-budget change and passes
with it. It covers a slow first endpoint, all endpoints timing out, an
overshooting executor, changing affinity, and preserved delivery authority.
The response-lifetime regression explicitly overwrites released response
storage: it reads `######` instead of `leader` before the fix and succeeds
afterward, including escaped strings without leaks. All 100 metadata service
checks and four focused data discovery/status checks passed.

A live HTTP proxy also reproduced the original create-admission signature
before the fix and completed the full backup/restore test afterward. The
retained regression keeps a stalled alternate status route first and all three
direct metadata addresses available, so leadership changes cannot accidentally
hide the only leader route. Fault activation follows cluster bootstrap.

## Synchronous resolver retry returns before queued backfill applies (#694)

[PR #694, run 34432995411, job 102732550441](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34432995411/job/102732550441)
failed `db drains pending resolver backfill when retrying a no-op upsertResolver`
with `NotFound` when reading the expected resolution artifact.

The resolver worker can enqueue the final corpus window and clear its durable
cursor before replay materializes the output. A synchronous no-op upsert checked
only that cursor, so it could return with replay still pending. A synchronous
backfill driver could likewise see a completed window with zero records queued
by that driver and skip its final replay drain.

Synchronous upserts now drain replay even when the corpus cursor is already
empty, and synchronous backfill always completes a final replay drain. Managed
`drain_backfill=false` callers retain asynchronous execution and nonblocking
catalog admission. No production timeout or test assertion is relaxed.

The regression preserves the original worker-enabled case and adds a controlled
interleaving: disable resolver workers, enqueue all corpus windows, verify the
cursor is gone but target sequence exceeds applied sequence and the output is
absent, then retry the same catalog config. It fails with the exact CI
`NotFound` before the fix and passes afterward. All five focused catalog,
generation-change, deferred-reopen, and backfill checks passed without leaks in
`zig build antfly-resolver-backfill-test -j4`.

## Standalone routing watch deadline (#689, #694)

[PR #689, run 34418061842, job 102687782332](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34418061842/job/102687782332)
failed `standalone routing watch does not report absence after one probe` with
`expected .authoritative_absence, found .retry`. The real-clock test used a 60 ms
deadline; scheduling delay can exhaust the confirmation budget, so the
deadline-aware mutex correctly returns a retry instead of certifying absence.

[PR #694](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/694) accepts that retry only after
deadline expiry and retains the minimum-wait and unexpected-change assertions.
The watch and mutex deadline checks share an injectable monotonic clock. Manual
time requires successful confirmation before expiry and checks an overshooting
sleep, an already-expired caller budget, and mutex contention. Production keeps
the same monotonic time, sleep, and yield operations.

Validation on macOS ARM64: all 108 standalone runtime tests passed without
leaks. Setting the confirmation budget to zero temporarily made the new test
fail with the original expected/actual mismatch; the mutation was reverted.
Both routing-watch tests passed in #694's subsequent Linux x86_64 CI run
34423487352. That run failed in the unrelated dense rollback test below.

## Dense generation rollback activation budget (#694, #695)

[PR #694, run 34423487352, job 102704099568](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34423487352/job/102704099568)
failed `db failed activated dense generation rolls back to retained predecessor`.
The second repair returned `failed=1`, `unresolved=1`, and remaining debt instead
of reaching the injected `TestCrashBeforeReplacementValidation` error.

The functional rollback test used the 250 ms production activation budget.
A temporary 350 ms pause after persisting the activating phase reproduced the
CI signature on macOS ARM64. [PR #695](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/695),
commit `d36b3492d`, uses the existing five-second functional-test options for the
predecessor build, crash-injected replacement, and final recovery rebuild. It
also asserts that the predecessor completed successfully before testing
rollback. The production limit and crash, rollback, and search assertions stay
in place. The fix is also included in #694.

The injected-pause case passed after the fix. After removing the temporary hook,
all 68 tests in `zig build dense-index-lifecycle-regression-test -j4` passed
without leaks. Formatting and diff checks passed. The Linux x86_64 unit job on
#695 also passed ([run 34427566807, job 102716322007](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34427566807/job/102716322007)).
The same 68 tests passed again after inclusion in #694 with current main.

## Backup seed forwarding exhausts the control executor (#694)

[PR #694, run 34423487352, job 102714559943](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34423487352/job/102714559943)
failed the three-by-three backup E2E case while seeding its three documents:
HTTP 409 `write outcome unknown`. The artifact contained only the executable,
so the original CI log does not identify the underlying transport error.

On macOS ARM64, a native Debug build based on main `9f192f9be` reproduced the
same seed failure in **1/30 concurrent runs**. Adding error-path diagnostics
then reproduced it in **7/60 runs**, all with `ConcurrencyUnavailable` inside
the forwarded group batch HTTP client. The client conservatively translates
transport errors after its send boundary into an ambiguous write outcome;
the test correctly fails instead of blindly replaying the batch.

Both known-leader and placement-fallback forwarding used `dataRaftIo()`, which
selects the runtime's eight-worker control executor. HTTP forwarding submits
nested request, deadline, and connection tasks. Concurrent transaction
participants compete with control work for those eight slots, and admission
failure can occur after a request starts. The initial fix moved forwarding to
the bounded outbound Raft network executor. The review follow-up above replaces
that sharing with a dedicated lane and whole-request admission. Control waits retain their executor,
and borrowed runtimes retain their caller-supplied transport authority. Neither
the aggregate worker budget nor the write deadline is increased.

The deterministic regression occupies every control slot, verifies that one
more task is rejected, then sends a real forwarded batch to a loopback peer.
With the old executor it fails with `RaftBatchWriteTransportOutcomeUnknown`
and underlying `ConcurrencyUnavailable`; with the fix it receives HTTP 201 and
verifies exactly one request. The borrowed-VoprIo and forwarding-error
classification regressions also pass. Diagnostics now retain the underlying
HTTP error, delivery phase, and timeout without logging request bodies.
The broader HTTP client regression had three stale expectations for transport
failures after #692 introduced the distinct internal error; they now require
`RaftBatchWriteTransportOutcomeUnknown`. Peer-reported ambiguity still requires
`RaftBatchWriteOutcomeUnknown`, and definite pre-send failure remains distinct.

The E2E fixture also declares its process resource explicitly: before the fix,
pytest collection classified this six-process cluster as `light`; afterward it
uses `antfly-process`. See the [E2E entry](e2e/FLAKES.md#three-by-three-backup-seed-batch-unknown-outcome-694)
for final soak results and remaining CI validation.

## Serverless build-status PreconditionFailed during publication (#692)

[CI run 34420585088, job 102704104941](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34420585088/job/102704104941?pr=692)
failed `test_index_lifecycle.py::test_serverless_named_embedding_indexes_report_publication_actions`
while polling build status after deleting `semantic_a` and republishing the
remaining named embedding indexes. `/build-status` returned HTTP 500, and the
server logged `table build status failed ... err=PreconditionFailed`.
The job finished with 398 passed, five skipped, and this one failure. The
Autograph test passed; this is separate from the resolver/Raft cycle below.

### Cause and fix

Filesystem object publication writes a complete staged object and atomically
renames it over the destination. `FilesystemClient.getObject` previously opened
the path for metadata, closed it, then reopened it to read the payload. If a
publisher replaced the path between those opens, the second header had a new
ETag and the reader returned `PreconditionFailed` even for an unconditional GET.
Concurrent deletion could similarly produce `FileNotFound` after metadata had
already been selected. Build-status reads mutable progress/HEAD objects through
this backend, making active publication a trigger for the HTTP failure. The CI
log does not identify the particular object key that raced.

GET now keeps one file descriptor open for metadata, conditional ETag checks,
range/part selection, and payload reads. Atomic replacement or unlink leaves
that selected generation readable through the open descriptor. A later GET
observes the replacement or deletion. Explicit stale `If-Match` requests still
fail; response-size limits and cancellation remain in force. No HTTP retries,
longer polling deadlines, or publication locks are added.

### Deterministic regression and validation

The regression publishes or deletes the object at the existing cancellation
checkpoint after metadata selection and before payload reading, without
canceling the read. On unmodified `origin/main` at
`9f192f9be68219d08944d51552dbf4eb782891f1`, it fails with `PreconditionFailed`
from the second open in `readObjectRangeAlloc`. With the fix, all 12 cases pass:
shorter replacement, longer replacement, and deletion, each during full, range,
part, and matching conditional GETs. Assertions check the original body, size,
ETag, checksum metadata, and content type, plus subsequent reads and stale ETags.

The standalone object-store suite passes in Debug and ReleaseFast: **69 passed,
two opt-in cloud integration tests skipped** in each mode. The root
`lib-objectstore-test` target also passes with the same counts; the suite is now
included in the default `lib-test` CI aggregate. The focused serverless manifest
suite passes **12/12**.

The macOS arm64 ReleaseFast executable (SHA-256
`fa2c790e57cea2cc35cc449ce01839e146eb781795b9d525e043f2af74cf32bd`)
passes **30/30** repetitions of the failing E2E test with three concurrent
workers. All **11/11** serverless index-lifecycle cases also pass. The first
sandboxed launch could not bind a localhost port; these results are from the
successful rerun with local-server access. The HTTP flake was not reproduced
in a baseline E2E soak; the before/after evidence is the deterministic backend
regression, and the passing E2E soak validates the integrated fix.

## Autograph second-document write timeout (#690)

[CI run 34395199129, job 102623777993](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34395199129/job/102623777993?pr=690)
failed the first of three low-descriptor repetitions of
`test_resolution.py::test_multinode_autograph_resolves_promotes_and_hydrates_entities`.
The `doc:b` batch timed out after 30 seconds. Data node 101 reported
`target=4 applied=3`, `diagnostics=raft_mutex_contended`, and an unknown outcome
after proposal. Resolution also reported `ReadIndexTimeout`. GDB attachment was
denied by the runner's ptrace policy, leaving no usable native stacks.

The worktree starts at `origin/main` commit `26e332ed8c335d75eecd875548c6c36bcb47d183`.
The original ReleaseFast CI executable reproduces the same `doc:b` timeout and
Raft diagnostics under concurrent Linux load: **5 failures in 30 runs**. Three
serial Linux runs passed. The reproduction uses the runner image, a 50 GiB
`standard-rwo` disk, eight-CPU affinity, and `RLIMIT_NOFILE=256`. A disposable
test launcher enables same-UID GDB attachment; the original artifact is stripped,
so those stacks contain addresses without Antfly symbols.

### Cause and fix

A symbolized, unmodified `main` ReleaseFast build reproduced the failure in
**1 of 30 runs**. The native stacks established this cycle:

1. `runProvisionedRootRefresh` holds a group refresh activity and calls
   `reconcileReplicaRootTablesWithWriteCache` → `backfillResolverCorpus`.
2. Resolver catch-up calls the distributed candidate source, whose cross-shard
   scan waits for `data_raft_mutex` to submit ReadIndex.
3. The Raft progress thread holds `data_raft_mutex` in `applyReady` and waits
   inside `beginReplicatedApplyOperationLocked` for that same refresh activity.

Managed metadata refresh now persists resolver configuration and durable backfill
cursors without running resolution or promotion inline. The resolution worker
owns bounded cursor scans and replay, wakes for catalog-only changes, and reloads
pending cursors after reopen. Cached cold opens defer resolver workers until the
stable cache entry has its distributed candidate source, entity sink, and
promotion-owner callbacks installed.

Catalog changes use nonblocking resolution/promotion callback fences while a
managed refresh owns a group activity. A busy worker causes the refresh to yield
and retry. Material configuration changes atomically reset both durable cursors
with the catalog, so a previous scan cannot clear a new generation's work.
Promotion checks the live resolver generation under the same callback fence and
skips queued artifacts from superseded configurations.
Removal retains the catalog until artifact retirement and graph replay finish;
retries do not enqueue deletes for already absent artifacts. Follower retirement
fences callbacks without waiting for leader-only promotion work. Embedded callers
retain their synchronous resolver API.

Committed Raft apply also tries the read-compatible group activity once, including
nonblocking acquisition of its bookkeeping mutex. Contention returns
`RaftApplyWriterUnavailable` before document mutation or cache invalidation. The
state-machine checkpoint preserves exactly-once document effects across retries.
The original nonblocking fix still returned from the entire host drain on this
error: a review probe showed three rounds with zero healthy read completions or
transport sends until the blocked group was released.

MultiRaft now classifies replay-safe apply backpressure explicitly and defers only
the affected group. It preserves that group's snapshot, entry, and ReadState order
while a persistent cursor gives other groups turns, including with a one-task
budget. Persisted transport can flush during deferral. Fatal apply/persistence
errors still stop the turn. Async storage-apply acknowledgements and snapshot
compaction are emitted only after the corresponding task completes. Legacy apply
queues retain their completed-prefix contract unless they opt into this scheduling.

Regressions hold real refresh activity and its bookkeeping mutex while applying a
committed increment. Attempts must return before release, leave the document and
watermark unchanged, and keep write/read waiters pending. The production router
must complete another group's read while refresh remains held. After release, the
increment applies exactly once. MultiRaft tests separately cover transport, bounded
fairness, snapshot order, fatal errors, opt-in queues, and async acknowledgements.
DB tests cover durable worker-only backfill after deferred activation/reopen,
configuration fencing and cursor reset, and resolver retirement on leaders and
followers. Watchdogs release held owners before joining on regression failure.

### Read deadline defect

`DataServer.waitDataReadSafeWithCancellation` registered its waiter, acquired
`data_raft_mutex` with an unbounded wait, and only then started its five-second
read timeout. Resolution's cross-shard reads therefore could neither time out
nor cancel while waiting for a contended Raft owner. Managed writer/worker
dependencies can keep that wait alive beyond the public write deadline.

The read now uses one absolute deadline across owner-lock admission and the
matching quorum/apply barrier. Lock contention yields through the runtime's
`std.Io`, checks cancellation and remaining time, and releases waiter ownership
on failure. It rechecks the deadline after acquiring the mutex before submitting
ReadIndex. Quorum, applied-index, restart-fencing, and write-success requirements
remain in force; neither the test's write timeout nor its retry policy changes.

The deterministic regression holds the owner mutex, starts a read, and verifies
that timeout or cancellation completes before the owner is released. A watchdog
always releases the owner before joining, so the original code fails without
hanging the runner. It also checks expired requests, pre-cancellation, lock
release, and waiter cleanup. The original implementation fails this regression;
the fixed implementation passes. The test is selected by the default data-runtime
suite.

### Diagnostics and validation

The regression script's existing `ANTFLY_E2E_NATIVE_STACKS=1` now enables an
exec launcher for the multi-node fixture on Linux. Only disposable test children
opt into sibling debugger attachment; host ptrace policy and production startup
are unchanged. The launcher preserves server PIDs and arguments.

Validation on 2026-09-09:

- Original native Debug: 160/160 passes at 256 descriptors, including six
  concurrent workers. This did not reproduce the Linux failure.
- Descriptor probes: 9/9 passes at 192 and 9/9 at 160. At 128, three runs failed
  with descriptor-exhausted node exits, a different signature.
- Deadline-only native Debug: 30/30 concurrent runs passed.
- Deadline-only Linux Debug: 30/30 concurrent runs passed.
- Final code: all 109 data-Raft tests passed, as did the production DataServer
  VOPR merge/read-barrier scenario. Both deterministic regressions fail on
  the original implementation and pass with the fix. No leaks were reported.
- Fifteen Python launcher/resolution checks passed; sibling GDB attachment was
  also verified on the Linux runner.
- Deadline-only Linux ReleaseFast: 60/60 concurrent runs passed.
- Final nonblocking apply + deadline Linux ReleaseFast: **60/60 concurrent
  runs passed** at 256 descriptors with eight-CPU affinity.
- Final Linux ReleaseFast: the regression script’s default schema-migration
  and automatic shard-split cases both passed under the same resource limits.

Reproduce from the worktree root with a built executable:

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=1 ANTFLY_E2E_ENV_LOADED=1 ANTFLY_E2E_NOFILE_LIMIT=256 \
ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS=3 ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS=10 \
scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh \
  e2e/antfly/test_resolution.py::test_multinode_autograph_resolves_promotes_and_hydrates_entities
```

On Linux, prefix the script with `taskset -c 0-7` when those CPUs are available.
Build with `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dstrip=false` for symbolized reproduction.
Local investigation logs are retained under `/private/tmp/antfly-ci690-*`.

Run the deterministic regressions from `zig/`:

```sh
zig build antfly-data-runtime-test -- \
  --test-filter 'data raft apply defers refresh contention' \
  --test-filter 'data raft read safety' \
  --test-filter 'data raft retry checkpoints' \
  --test-filter 'production DataServer replicated merge actions run on VoprIo'
```

### Architectural follow-up validation (#692)

The review-driven worker ownership and per-group apply changes are tracked in
[PR #692](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/692).

- Full standalone Raft suite: 391 tests passed.
- Full data-runtime suite: 173 tests passed, including production VOPR cases.
- Resolver/promotion suite: 38 tests passed, including deferred worker
  activation/reopen, configuration fencing, stale promotion rejection, and
  follower removal. The final focused data-Raft/VOPR suite also passed 110 tests.
- Managed writer-cache/restore lifecycle suite: 218 tests passed.
- Python launcher/resolution checks: 15 passed.
- Final Linux ReleaseFast soak: **60/60 passed**, with three workers,
  eight CPUs (`0-6,8`), and 256 descriptors.
- The same final Linux build passed both default regression-loop cases:
  full-text schema migration and automatic shard splitting.
  Executable SHA-256: `a3c6e7987c0eadc0f633b58373d18ec0e13e0e6529fded12eaf37d966fe317f1`.

Run the durable backfill and catalog lifecycle checks from `zig/`:

```sh
zig build antfly-storage-db-test -- --test-filter resolver --test-filter reresolve \
  --test-filter PromotionRuntime --test-filter processResolutionArtifact \
  --test-filter catchUpWindow --test-filter 'db promotes'
```
