# Auth

This document records the current Antfly auth model and the planned document-level security shape for user/tenant-aware row filters.

## Current Auth Context

When `auth_enabled` is true, public non-internal routes authenticate through the configured user manager.

Supported credential forms:

- `Basic <base64(username:password)>`
- `ApiKey <base64(key_id:key_secret)>`
- `Bearer <base64(key_id:key_secret)>`

The request auth layer builds an `AuthenticatedIdentity` with:

- `username`: authenticated username, or API-key owner username
- `permissions`: table/user/global permissions used for route authorization
- `row_filter`: stored row filter policies attached to the user or API key
- `roles`: inherited Casbin grouping subjects for the authenticated user
- `metadata`: trusted user metadata used by stored row-filter `$auth` references

Route authorization is coarse-grained and permission based. Document-level read narrowing is enforced separately by row filters.
Table lookup, query, and document-scan routes require `read` permission on the target table.

### API Key Secret Storage And Verification

API key secrets are generated as high-entropy random values, so verification hashes them with a salted SHA-256 rather than a slow password-style KDF: each key gets its own random salt, and the stored verifier is the hash of the salt concatenated with the secret. A slow adaptive hash exists to make guessing a low-entropy human-chosen password expensive; a random 128-bit secret is already infeasible to guess, so spending extra CPU on a deliberately slow hash on every request would only add latency without adding security.

At verification time the server always computes and compares the secret hash before it checks the key's expiration, never the other way around. Checking expiration first would let a request against an expired key fail differently from a request against a truly unknown key, which leaks whether a given key ID ever existed; verifying the hash unconditionally first keeps "wrong secret" and "expired key" indistinguishable from an unauthenticated caller's point of view until the hash has already matched.

When an API key is created with an explicit permission set, each requested permission is checked against the creating user's currently granted permissions and rejected if it would exceed them: a key can only narrow what its creator can already do, never broaden it. The same effective-permission narrowing (the key's explicit permissions intersected with its owner's current permissions) is re-applied on every use, so a later reduction in the owner's own access also narrows what the key can do.

## Row Filter Enforcement

Row filters are stored as query JSON per table name, with `*` as a wildcard table fallback.

At read time the server:

1. Finds the table-specific row filter, or the wildcard row filter.
2. Resolves trusted auth-context references in that stored filter.
3. Conjoins the resolved filter with any user-supplied query filter.
4. Executes the resulting query, scan, or lookup filter.

Row-filter writes are also validated before storage. A `$auth` node must be an object with exactly one field, and the field value must be a supported auth path.

This keeps access control server-owned. Client-supplied queries may narrow their own results, but they are not trusted to enforce access control.

## Canonical Auth Reference Form

The canonical stored representation should be typed, not a whole-query template:

```json
{
  "term": {
    "tenant_id": { "$auth": "metadata.tenant_id" }
  }
}
```

The resolver expands `$auth` nodes after authentication and before query execution. The resolved filter must be normal query JSON:

```json
{
  "term": {
    "tenant_id": "acme"
  }
}
```

This is intentionally similar to Elasticsearch document-level security user templates, but the stored Antfly representation remains an inspectable JSON AST. Whole-query Handlebars rendering should not be the default.

## Why Not Template Every Query

Antfly already has two separate styles:

- Transform DSL: structured Mongo-style mutation operations such as `$set`, `$inc`, and `$addToSet`.
- Handlebars templates: rendering text, document prompts, keys, and source-derived values.

Security filters should follow the transform style: structured query shape with explicit dynamic value nodes. Templating every query would make every query parse two-phase, introduce JSON escaping/injection risks, weaken validation, and blur trusted policy from untrusted user query.

## Planned Auth Context Shape

The target auth context is:

```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "roles": ["reader", "tenant_member"],
  "metadata": {
    "tenant_id": "acme",
    "department": "eng",
    "groups": ["search", "infra"]
  },
  "auth_type": "user"
}
```

API keys should have explicit semantics:

- `username`: the authenticated username, or the API-key owner username.
- Metadata should either inherit from the owner or merge owner metadata with key metadata by well-defined narrowing rules.
- Key metadata should not silently broaden access.
- Row filters inherit the owner's effective user/role filters; key-local filters apply as an additional narrowing layer.
- An auth type such as `user` vs `api_key` may be exposed when policies need to distinguish credential class.

## Supported First Slice

The implemented auth references resolve username, inherited roles, and user metadata in stored row filters:

```json
{ "term": { "owner": { "$auth": "username" } } }
```

```json
{ "term": { "tenant_id": { "$auth": "metadata.tenant_id" } } }
```

```json
{ "terms": { "acl.roles": { "$auth": "roles" } } }
```

Metadata and roles come from the authenticated user. API-key authentication currently inherits the API-key owner's user metadata and roles.

Do not add aliases such as `user.username` or `_user.username` unless a future auth-context field needs that distinction. Keeping the first DSL surface to `username` makes stored policy easier to read, validate, and migrate.

`$auth: "roles"` resolves to an array of inherited grouping subjects. That is useful with array-aware query operators such as `terms`; it should not be used with scalar-only operators.

## Roles And Groups

Antfly's default Casbin model already has the shape we need:

```ini
[policy_definition]
p = sub, typ, obj, act
p2 = sub, obj, filter

[role_definition]
g = _, _
```

`p` grants coarse permissions. `p2` stores row filters. `g` expresses subject inheritance.

Roles and groups are both Casbin subjects. Use prefixes to keep intent clear:

- `role:tenant_reader`
- `role:admin`
- `group:eng`
- `group:search`

Membership examples:

```text
g, alice, role:tenant_reader
g, alice, group:eng
g, group:eng, role:internal_reader
```

Effective permissions and effective row filters should follow the same inheritance rule: collect direct user policies plus policies attached to inherited `g` subjects. When multiple row filters apply to the same table, Antfly conjoins them.

For document ACLs, prefer metadata when the document stores business groups:

```json
{
  "terms": {
    "acl.groups": { "$auth": "metadata.groups" }
  }
}
```

Use Casbin `g` groups for authorization inheritance. Use user metadata groups for query-time document matching. They can share names, but they are not the same field.

## Auth Management API

The canonical auth management API is namespaced under `/auth/v1`. The older top-level `/users` shape should not be kept as a compatibility alias while this surface is still settling.

Canonical route shape:

```text
GET    /auth/v1/me
GET    /auth/v1/users
POST   /auth/v1/users/{userName}
GET    /auth/v1/users/{userName}
DELETE /auth/v1/users/{userName}
PUT    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/password

GET    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/permissions
POST   /auth/v1/users/{userName}/permissions
DELETE /auth/v1/users/{userName}/permissions?resource=...&resourceType=...

GET    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/roles
POST   /auth/v1/users/{userName}/roles
DELETE /auth/v1/users/{userName}/roles?role=...

GET    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/row-filters
GET    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/row-filters/{table}
PUT    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/row-filters/{table}
DELETE /auth/v1/users/{userName}/row-filters/{table}

GET    /auth/v1/users/{userName}/api-keys
POST   /auth/v1/users/{userName}/api-keys
DELETE /auth/v1/users/{userName}/api-keys/{keyId}

GET    /auth/v1/subjects
GET    /auth/v1/subjects/{subject}/row-filters
GET    /auth/v1/subjects/{subject}/row-filters/{table}
PUT    /auth/v1/subjects/{subject}/row-filters/{table}
DELETE /auth/v1/subjects/{subject}/row-filters/{table}
```

`GET /auth/v1/subjects` should be read-only discovery derived from Casbin policy state, not a separate subject registry.

## Startup Auth Model

Antfly should keep the canonical runtime model fixed for now:

- `p = sub, typ, obj, act`
- `p2 = sub, obj, filter`
- `g = _, _`

The server may accept startup configuration for users, metadata, roles, groups, memberships, permissions, and row filters. That is safer than accepting an arbitrary Casbin model because the runtime assumes the `p`, `p2`, and `g` shapes above.

A custom Casbin model can be an advanced future option, but it must validate that Antfly's required policy shapes still exist or provide explicit adapters for permission enforcement and row-filter extraction. Arbitrary model text should not silently change row-filter semantics.

## Examples

Per-owner access:

```json
{
  "term": {
    "owner": { "$auth": "username" }
  }
}
```

Tenant access, once metadata exists:

```json
{
  "term": {
    "tenant_id": { "$auth": "metadata.tenant_id" }
  }
}
```

Tenant and owner access:

```json
{
  "conjuncts": [
    { "term": { "tenant_id": { "$auth": "metadata.tenant_id" } } },
    { "term": { "owner": { "$auth": "username" } } }
  ]
}
```

Group ACL access with array-valued metadata and an array-aware `terms` filter:

```json
{
  "terms": {
    "acl.groups": { "$auth": "metadata.groups" }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Resolve `$auth` nodes in stored row filters before existing row-filter injection and scan/lookup evaluation.
2. Keep row-filter selection unchanged: table-specific first, wildcard second.
3. Validate stored row filters before persistence and validate resolved filters by parsing/evaluating them as normal query JSON.
4. Add API-key metadata if key-local narrowing is needed.
5. Keep roles/groups in Casbin `g` and collect inherited `p2` row filters for the effective authenticated user.
6. Resolve `$auth: "roles"` to inherited `g` subjects for array-aware policy queries.
7. Add optional startup configuration for users, metadata, memberships, permissions, and row filters.
8. Add optional authoring sugar only if needed, such as Elastic-style templates, but compile it into the canonical typed form before storage.
