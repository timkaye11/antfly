            This describes the static code-generation path; the repository also has an optional

            The loop: the drafter proposes k tokens cheaply, then the main model verifies all k
            positions together on eligible verifier routes. Accepted tokens amortize a target pass;
            a mismatch truncates the tail and requires replacement and KV-state handling. Greedy
            verification aims to preserve the target token sequence. Drafting, verification, and
            rejected work all cost time, and batched numerical behavior still needs parity checks.

            <strong>Acceptance alone is not speedup.</strong> An earlier E2B Metal CLI pilot
            recorded 75.9 tok/s target-only versus 63.7 with the BF16 draft at 64% acceptance. Its
            output did not record a binary identity, so the performance plan labels this directional
            evidence. Later server probes exercised the slow-path auto-disable and fallback
            behavior. Metal automatic MTP requires its explicit enable gate; a forced policy is a
            separate choice. These records do not predict current performance on other devices or
            runtimes.
