            An image is chopped into 16×16-pixel patches (doubled across a 2-frame temporal window), pushed
            through a 24-block vision tower, and merged 4-into-1 — a 768×768 image after resizing becomes 576 visual tokens
            of width {spec.stats.hidden}. From the decoder's perspective they are just embeddings in the
            sequence: attended to causally and cached in the same KV pools. Each visual token has the same
            decoder KV footprint as a text token, but images also require preprocessing, the vision tower,
            projector and DeepStack work.

            Every token carries <em>three</em> positions — temporal, height, width — and the
            head dimension is partitioned into interleaved sections rotating on each stream. In plain text the
            three clocks tick in lockstep, which collapses m-RoPE back to ordinary RoPE. Inside an image, the
            temporal hand freezes while h and w advance with the patch grid: two patches in the same row share
            an h phase, two in the same column share w.

            The vision tower's RoPE is <strong>two-axis</strong>: patch row and patch column, bidirectional,
            scoped to one image — it only ever needs to know where a patch sits in <em>its</em> grid. The
            decoder's m-RoPE is <strong>three-axis</strong> because its problem is disambiguation across an
            interleaved sequence. All axes advance together through text; image grids have their own
            spatial coordinates and start offsets derived from preceding content. Later text resumes
            after the largest coordinate used. The temporal axis also belongs to the upstream video
            architecture, although Antfly's current input path rejects video.
