            The input is a list of label names — <code>company</code>, <code>person</code>,{" "}
            <code>amount</code>, anything — encoded into the <em>same</em> token sequence as the text,
            separated by entity-marker tokens. One encoder pass later, every candidate span in the text has a
            score against every label. The spans above light up when their sigmoid score crosses the
            threshold; the example is illustrative, the mechanism is exactly what chapters 3–5 unpack.
          </p>
          <p>
            No autoregressive generation is needed. Zero-shot extraction uses the meaning of the supplied
            label names without training a new output class for each label. Label wording still matters: the
            schema is part of the encoded input, and changing it can change the results.

            Generative models decode token by token; Qwen3 Embedding uses a causal forward pass without

            <strong>No causal mask.</strong> Every token attends to every other token in both directions. For
            extraction that's not a nicety, it's the point: whether <em>"Ruiz"</em> is a person may hinge on
            the <em>"Dr."</em> before it and the <em>"hired"</em> before that — and on words that come after.
            The encoder attention mask handles padding; separate span masks exclude invalid candidates.

            including schema tokens). There are no paged pools, no
            eviction, no sampler — the KV and sampling stages of the shared spine simply don't exist for this
            model.

            DeBERTa's core idea: don't fold position into the token embedding. Keep <em>what a token is</em>{" "}
            and <em>where it is</em> as separate vectors, and let attention combine them three ways.

          <p>
            <strong>C2C</strong> is ordinary attention: content query dot content key, <code>Q_c · K_cᵀ</code>.
            Without any positional terms, attention cannot distinguish reordered content by its position
            alone: permuting the input permutes the outputs rather than teaching the model word order.

          <p>
            <strong>C2P and P2C</strong> add position back — from both sides. Content-to-position asks "how
            much does <em>this word</em> care about something <em>k slots away</em>?"; position-to-content
            asks the reverse. The three score matrices sum and scale by <code>1/√(3·d)</code> before softmax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relative-position <em>indices</em> repeat along diagonals; the scores also depend on the query
            or key content, so their diagonals need not be equal. The score-gather formulation uses a
            <code>[T × (2T−1)]</code> product per side and gathers by <code>qi−ki+T−1</code>.
            The fused graph path instead consumes content and relative projections directly.

            <strong>Distance is bucketed.</strong> <code>position_buckets = {String(spec.stats.relBuckets)}</code>
            is the signed-distance offset; the relative embedding table has 512 rows. Distances within
            ±128 map exactly; larger magnitudes use logarithmic buckets, shifted by 256 into table indices. Word order nearby is
            preserved precisely; far context blurs gracefully. And because position lives entirely inside
            attention, there are <em>no absolute position embeddings at all</em> — the embedding stage is
            lookup, LayerNorm, mask, nothing else.

            the positions where <code>input_ids == entity_token_id</code> — while token states pool into word
            representations. The serving head takes the first sub-token per word, including in its
            dedicated Metal kernel. The separate graph-training helper uses averaging, so these source
            paths should not be treated as identical implementations.

            Batching creates wider matrix operations, but padding, sequence length and head work affect
            efficiency. The CPU/GPU crossover is hardware- and workload-dependent; this walkthrough does
            not establish a performance threshold. Entity extraction is the path illustrated here;
            classification and relation extraction use additional task-specific pipeline logic.
