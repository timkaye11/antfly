            Three code facts gate serving. <code>detectArchitecture</code> recognizes a boundary bundle
            from <code>architecture: "boundary"</code> (and fails closed on ambiguity). The architecture
            module declares <code>runtime_available = false</code>. And the qualification table —
            which must pin an exact model identity, backend, feature set and length limit per row — is
            deliberately empty, with no environment override. The manifest ANDs all three, so listing,
            capability and compatibility APIs report the model as unsupported until a reviewed release
            decision adds a row. Nothing on this page is an availability or performance claim.
