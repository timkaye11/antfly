- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please use the feature request template and include:
- Use case for the feature
- Proposed API design
- Alternative solutions you've considered

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 24.0
- npm or yarn or pnpm
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/antfly-sdk-ts.git
cd antfly-sdk-ts
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development build watcher:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Type checking only
npm run test:ts
```

### Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the SDK
npm run build

# Generate types from OpenAPI spec
npm run generate
```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Unit Tests**: Write tests for your changes in the `test/` directory
2. **Type Tests**: Ensure TypeScript types are correct with `npm run test:ts`
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with the examples:
   ```bash
   # Test Node.js example
   npm run example:node
   
   # Test browser example
   npx http-server examples
   # Open http://localhost:8080/browser-example.html
   ```

### Regenerating Types

If the Antfly OpenAPI specification changes:

1. Update the OpenAPI spec file location in `package.json` if needed
2. Run: `npm run generate`
3. Review the changes in `src/antfly-api.d.ts`
4. Update `src/types.ts` if new type exports are needed
