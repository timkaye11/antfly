# Antfly React Components

`@antfly/components` is a React component library for building search interfaces with Antfly. It provides declarative components for search boxes, facets, results, pagination, and query building. The library is unstyled by design, allowing developers full control over presentation.

## Testing

- Uses Vitest with jsdom for testing React components
- Uses Mock Service Worker (MSW) for mocking API requests in tests
- Tests are located alongside component files (e.g., `SearchBox.test.tsx`)
- Test setup is in `vitest.setup.ts`
- Run specific test file: `vitest src/SearchBox.test.tsx`
- Run specific test: `vitest -t "test name pattern"`
- Run tests with UI: `vitest --ui`
- Run tests in watch mode: `vitest` (no arguments)

## Architecture

### State Management

The library uses a **centralized state system** via React Context:

- **`SharedContext.tsx`**: Defines the state shape and actions
- **`SharedContextProvider.tsx`**: Provides the context to components
- **`Antfly.tsx`**: Root component that initializes the context with a reducer

All components (SearchBox, Facet, Results, etc.) register themselves as **widgets** in the shared state. The `Listener` component coordinates queries by:
1. Collecting widget configurations
2. Building queries from widget state
3. Executing multi-query requests via `msearch()`
4. Distributing results back to widgets

### Widget System

Each interactive component is a "widget" that registers in `SharedState.widgets` Map with:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `needsQuery`: Whether it needs query results
- `needsConfiguration`: Whether it contributes to the query
- `isFacet`: Whether it's a facet component
- `rootQuery`: Whether it's a root query widget (SearchBox, RAGBox, AnswerBox)
- `isAutosuggest`: Whether it's an autosuggest widget (for isolation)
- `wantResults`: Whether it wants full results
- `wantFacets`: Whether it wants facet data
- `query`: The query it contributes
- `semanticQuery`: Semantic/vector search query text
- `isSemantic`: Whether semantic search is enabled
- `value`: Current selected/input value
- `submittedAt`: Timestamp of last submission
- `table`: Optional table override (single or multi-table)
- `filterQuery`: Query to constrain results
- `exclusionQuery`: Query to exclude matches
- `facetOptions`: Facet configurations for the widget
- `isLoading`: Loading state
- `configuration`: Component config (fields, size, etc.)
- `result`: Query results specific to this widget (data, facetData, total, error)

### Query Building

Queries are constructed from widget states using helper functions in `utils.ts`:
- `conjunctsFrom()`: Combines multiple queries with AND logic
- `disjunctsFrom()`: Combines queries with OR logic
- `toTermQueries()`: Creates term queries for facet selections

The library uses Antfly's query DSL (match, conjuncts, disjuncts) and communicates via the TypeScript SDK (`@antfly/sdk`).

### URL State Synchronization

- `toUrlQueryString()`: Serializes widget state to URL query params
- `fromUrlQueryString()`: Deserializes URL params back to state
- Supports browser back/forward navigation

## Key Components

### Search Components
- **Antfly**: Root provider component that initializes client and context
- **SearchBox**: Text search input with debouncing
- **Autosuggest**: Search box with autocomplete suggestions (can be standalone or nested in SearchBox/RAGBox/AnswerBox)
- **Facet**: Faceted navigation with term aggregations
- **Results**: Render search results with customizable item rendering
- **Pagination**: Page navigation controls
- **ActiveFilters**: Display and remove active filters

### RAG/AI Components
- **RAGBox**: Search input for retrieval-augmented generation queries (can contain Autosuggest)
- **RAGResults**: Display RAG results with streaming summary support
- **AnswerBox**: Legacy-named search input for Retrieval Agent queries (can contain Autosuggest)
- **AnswerResults**: Legacy-named Retrieval Agent results component with streaming reasoning and answers
- **AnswerFeedback**: Collect user ratings and comments on AI-generated answers (see `docs/feedback.md`)

### Hooks
- **useSearchHistory**: Manage search history with localStorage persistence (max results configurable, 0 to disable)
- **useAnswerStream**: Stream Retrieval Agent responses with state management (answer, reasoning, classification, hits, follow-up questions)
- **useCitations**: Parse and render citations in RAG and Retrieval Agent responses (supports `[resource_id X]` and `[X]` formats)

### Internal Components
- **Listener**: Internal component that coordinates queries (not typically used directly)
- **CustomWidget**: Extensibility point for custom search widgets

## SDK Integration

The library depends on `@antfly/sdk` (from `ts/` directory) which provides:
- `AntflyClient`: HTTP client for Antfly API
- Type definitions for queries and responses
- Multi-query support via `multiquery()`
- Streaming support for RAG and the Retrieval Agent

Client initialization happens in `Antfly` component via `initializeAntflyClient()`. The client is stored as a singleton accessible via `getAntflyClient()`.

### Streaming RAG and Retrieval Agent

The library provides `streamRAG()` and the legacy-named `streamAnswer()` utility (in `utils.ts`) for streaming responses:

```typescript
// RAG streaming
streamRAG(url, tableName, request, headers, {
  onHit: (hit) => { /* handle search hit */ },
  onSummary: (chunk) => { /* handle summary chunk */ },
  onComplete: () => { /* handle completion */ },
  onError: (error) => { /* handle error */ },
  onRAGResult: (result) => { /* handle non-streaming result */ }
});

// Retrieval Agent streaming
streamAnswer(url, request, headers, {
  onClassification: (data) => { /* handle query classification */ },
  onHit: (hit) => { /* handle search hit */ },
  onReasoning: (chunk) => { /* handle reasoning chunk */ },
  onGeneration: (chunk) => { /* handle generation chunk */ },
  onFollowup: (question) => { /* handle follow-up */ },
  onComplete: () => { /* handle completion */ }
});
```

Both functions return an `AbortController` for canceling streams.

## Build Output

The library is built as both ES modules and UMD:
- `dist/main.js`: ES module format
- `dist/main.umd.cjs`: UMD format for legacy usage
- `types/`: TypeScript declaration files

React, React DOM, and react/jsx-runtime are peer dependencies (not bundled).

## Publishing

Published to npm as `@antfly/components`. The package includes:
- Main entry: `dist/main.js`
- Types entry: `types/index.d.ts`
- Source maps for debugging

## Component Development Workflow

1. Create component in `src/` with corresponding `.test.tsx` file
2. Add component to `src/index.ts` exports
3. Create story in `stories/` for documentation
4. Run `npm run storybook` to develop interactively
5. Run tests with `npm test`
6. Lint and type-check before committing

## Important Architecture Patterns

### Widget Isolation (Autosuggest vs. Search)

The `Listener` component (src/Listener.tsx:154-193) implements widget isolation to prevent query interference:

- **Autosuggest widgets** are completely isolated - they only see their own queries
- **Root query widgets** (SearchBox, RAGBox, AnswerBox) exclude other root queries but include facet filters
- **Facet widgets** see all non-autosuggest queries

This prevents autocomplete dropdowns from affecting main search results and vice versa.

### Multi-Table Support

Widgets support a `table` prop to override the default table from `Antfly`:
- Single table: `table="products"`
- Priority: `widget.table` > `Antfly.table`
- Resolved via `resolveTable()` in utils.ts:144-154

### Citation Handling (RAG/Retrieval Agent)

The `citations.ts` module provides utilities for parsing and rendering citations in AI responses:

```typescript
// Parse citations from text
const citations = parseCitations(text); // Finds [doc_id X] or [X] patterns

// Replace with custom rendering
const rendered = replaceCitations(text, {
  renderCitation: (ids, allIds) => renderAsSequentialLinks(ids, allIds)
});

// Extract cited document IDs
const citedIds = getCitedDocumentIds(summary);
const citedHits = hits.filter(hit => citedIds.includes(hit._id));
```

Supports formats: `[doc_id 1, 2]` and shorthand `[1, 2]`

### Query Debouncing

The `Listener` batches rapid widget updates with a 15ms debounce (src/Listener.tsx:448) to minimize network calls when multiple widgets update simultaneously.
