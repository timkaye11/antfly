    """Restore multiple tables from a backup

     Restores tables from a cluster backup. Can restore all tables or a subset.

    **Restore Modes:**
    - `fail_if_exists`: Abort if any target table already exists (default)
    - `skip_if_exists`: Skip existing tables and restore the rest
    - `overwrite`: Stage and validate replacement generations, then atomically publish them over
    existing tables.

    The restore is a durable asynchronous job. The request returns after the
    job record is persisted and both a durable job store and asynchronous
    worker are available. Poll the restore job resource for progress.
    Catalog publication is durably checkpointed per table and is not
    repeated after restart. If leadership changes before that checkpoint,
    recovery adopts only an exact, still-active restore intent for the same
    backup and location; unrelated or ambiguous existing tables fail closed.
    A job reaches `succeeded` only after all placement replicas report the
    restore complete and metadata clears the restore intent. Cancellation is
    cooperative between table publication boundaries. Remote transfer and
    staging occur before the per-table write fence. Publication stops new
    admission and drains current readers and writers before swapping the
    direct-path generation.
