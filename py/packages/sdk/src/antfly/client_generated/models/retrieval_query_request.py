@_attrs_define
class RetrievalQueryRequest:
    r"""A canonical query in the retrieval pipeline with an optional tree search
    configuration. Each query specifies its own table. Deprecated stateful
    graph_searches compatibility is intentionally unavailable here.

    When both search fields (semantic_search, full_text_search) and tree_search
    are provided, the search results are used as start nodes for tree navigation.

        Attributes:
            table (str | Unset): Name of the table to query. Optional for global queries. Example: wikipedia.
            query (QueryRequestQuery | Unset): Canonical public query AST. Prefer this field for new clients.

                Boolean clauses are normalized before planning:
                - `bool.must` is scoring query input.
                - `bool.filter` is non-scoring query input.
                - `bool.must_not` is non-scoring exclusion query input.

                Filter branches accept the same query variants as `filter_query` and
                `exclusion_query`. Structured clauses use the native document-value
                path; text clauses are resolved through the text index before scoring.
                 Example: {'bool': {'must': [{'match': {'field': 'body', 'text': 'computer'}}], 'filter': [{'term': {'path':
                '/tenant', 'value': 'acme'}}], 'must_not': [{'exists': {'path': '/deleted_at'}}]}}.
            full_text_search (BooleanQuery | BoolFieldQuery | ConjunctionQuery | DateRangeStringQuery | DisjunctionQuery |
                DocIdQuery | FuzzyQuery | GeoBoundingBoxQuery | GeoBoundingPolygonQuery | GeoDistanceQuery | GeoShapeQuery |
                IPRangeQuery | MatchAllQuery | MatchNoneQuery | MatchPhraseQuery | MatchQuery | MultiMatchQuery |
                MultiPhraseQuery | NumericRangeQuery | PhraseQuery | PrefixQuery | QueryStringQuery | RegexpQuery | TermQuery |
                TermRangeQuery | Unset | WildcardQuery):
            full_text_index (str | Unset): Full-text index used by `full_text_search` and by scoring text clauses in
                `query`.
                Use this to query a named document- or artifact-backed full-text index. The selected
                index must exist and have type `full_text`. Omit this field to use the table's active
                schema full-text index, preserving v0.2 behavior. Structured document filters continue
                to use the active schema index even when retrieval uses a named artifact index. This
                selector is invalid without `full_text_search` or a scoring text clause in `query` and
                receives HTTP 422. This semantic relationship is enforced after the recursive query AST
                is normalized; OpenAPI presence checks cannot accurately distinguish scoring clauses
                from filter-only or exclusion-only trees.
                 Example: document_text.
            semantic_search (str | Unset): Natural language query for vector similarity search. Results are ranked by
                semantic similarity
                to the query and can be combined with full_text_search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

                The semantic_search string is automatically embedded using the configured embedding model
                for the specified indexes. UTF-8 input is limited to 1 MiB. Use `embedding_template` for
                multimodal queries.
                 Example: artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.
            embedding_template (str | Unset): Optional Handlebars template for multimodal embedding of the semantic_search
                query.
                The template has access to `this` which contains the semantic_search string value.

                UTF-8 template input is limited to 64 KiB.

                Use this when you want to embed template-time multimodal content instead of
                just text. The template is rendered using dotprompt with access to remote content helpers.

                **Available Helpers**:
                - `remoteMedia url=<url>` - Fetches and embeds remote images/media
                - `remotePDF url=<url>` - **Deprecated.** Fetches and extracts text from born-digital PDFs
                - `remoteText url=<url>` - Fetches and includes remote text content

                Use a `document_extraction` asset producer when PDF pages and chunks must be persisted
                and reprocessed. `remoteMedia` and the other helpers only prepare template-time inference input.

                **Examples**:
                - Legacy PDF search: `{{remotePDF url=this}}`
                - Image search: `{{remoteMedia url=this}}`
                - Mixed: `Search for: {{this}} {{#if this}}{{remoteMedia url=this}}{{/if}}`

                When not specified, the semantic_search string is embedded as plain text.
                 Example: {{remoteMedia url=this}}.
            indexes (list[str] | Unset): Embedding index names selected for `semantic_search` or explicit `embeddings`.
                Dense and sparse indexes are supported when the corresponding query representation is
                supplied. Provisioned deployments require at least one index for `semantic_search`;
                serverless may infer its single published dense index when this field is omitted. When
                `embeddings` is supplied without this field, the embedding map keys select the indexes.
                Provisioned results from multiple indexes are merged using RRF. Serverless currently
                executes at most one dense and one sparse index per request; it rejects multiple
                same-kind selectors and omitted selectors when more than one corresponding index is
                published rather than choosing an index by catalog order.
                 Example: ['title_body_nomic', 'description_embedding'].
            filter_prefix (str | Unset): Filter results by key prefix. Only returns documents whose keys start with this
                string.
                Applied before scoring to improve performance.

                Common use cases:
                - Multi-tenant filtering: `"tenant:acme:"`
                - User-specific data: `"user:123:"`
                - Document type filtering: `"article:"`
            filter_query (BooleanQuery | BoolFieldQuery | ConjunctionQuery | DateRangeStringQuery | DisjunctionQuery |
                DocIdQuery | FuzzyQuery | GeoBoundingBoxQuery | GeoBoundingPolygonQuery | GeoDistanceQuery | GeoShapeQuery |
                IPRangeQuery | MatchAllQuery | MatchNoneQuery | MatchPhraseQuery | MatchQuery | MultiMatchQuery |
                MultiPhraseQuery | NumericRangeQuery | PhraseQuery | PrefixQuery | QueryStringQuery | RegexpQuery | TermQuery |
                TermRangeQuery | Unset | WildcardQuery):
            exclusion_query (BooleanQuery | BoolFieldQuery | ConjunctionQuery | DateRangeStringQuery | DisjunctionQuery |
                DocIdQuery | FuzzyQuery | GeoBoundingBoxQuery | GeoBoundingPolygonQuery | GeoDistanceQuery | GeoShapeQuery |
                IPRangeQuery | MatchAllQuery | MatchNoneQuery | MatchPhraseQuery | MatchQuery | MultiMatchQuery |
                MultiPhraseQuery | NumericRangeQuery | PhraseQuery | PrefixQuery | QueryStringQuery | RegexpQuery | TermQuery |
                TermRangeQuery | Unset | WildcardQuery):
            aggregations (QueryRequestAggregations | Unset): Aggregation requests for computing metrics and bucketing
                results.
                Each key is a user-defined name for the aggregation, and the value specifies the aggregation configuration.

                When `hierarchy.group_by` is present, aggregations operate on the complete
                set of top-level grouped source or unit records. Nested `group_by.matches` are
                bounded evidence projections and are not counted as aggregation rows.

                Supports metric aggregations (sum, avg, min, max, count, stats, cardinality),
                bucketing aggregations (terms, range, date_range, histogram, date_histogram),
                geo aggregations (geohash_grid, geo_distance), and analytics (significant_terms).

                Example:
                ```json
                {
                  "price_stats": {
                    "type": "stats",
                    "field": "price"
                  },
                  "categories": {
                    "type": "terms",
                    "field": "category",
                    "size": 10
                  }
                }
                ```
            embeddings (QueryRequestEmbeddings | Unset): Pre-computed embeddings to use for semantic searches instead of
                embedding the semantic_search string.
                The keys are the index names. Values can be either:
                - **Dense (array)**: an array of floats, e.g. `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]`
                - **Dense (packed)**: a base64 string of little-endian float32 bytes (~4x more compact)
                - **Sparse**: an object with `indices` (array of ints) and `values` (array of floats),
                  e.g. `{"indices": [1, 5, 100], "values": [0.3, 0.7, 0.1]}`
                - **Sparse (packed)**: an object with `packed_indices` (base64 uint32 LE) and `packed_values` (base64 float32
                LE)

                Use when you've already generated embeddings on the client side to avoid redundant embedding calls.
            search_effort (float | Unset): Controls the vector search recall/latency tradeoff for semantic searches.

                - `0.0` = fastest, lowest recall
                - `0.5` = balanced default
                - `1.0` = highest recall

                When omitted, Antfly uses the balanced default effort (`0.5`) unless
                lower-level vector search overrides are provided internally.
                 Default: 0.5. Example: 0.5.
            fields (list[str] | Unset): List of fields to include in the results. If not specified, all fields are returned.
                Use to reduce response size and improve performance. This field is required when
                hierarchy.group_by is present so a grouped query cannot accidentally hydrate an
                entire grouped document. Use an empty array for identity-only groups.
                This projection is also required for hierarchy.children traversal.
                 Example: ['title', 'url', 'summary', 'created_at'].
            hierarchy (QueryHierarchy | Unset): Returns direct index matches with optional projected ancestor context, or
                groups
                those matches at a hierarchy level through `group_by`. A group's nested `matches`
                projection is independently bounded and defaults to three hits while the top-level
                `limit` continues to control the number of groups.

                `children` is a separate sequential-browsing operation. It enumerates every unit
                in the selected source revision, including units with no searchable chunk, and uses
                the top-level `_sort`/`search_after` cursor contract.

                Ancestor and nested-match field projections are always explicit to keep response
                size predictable. The presence of this object selects the canonical contract:
                without `group_by` or `children`, including when the object is empty, direct index
                matches are returned. `ancestors` only controls projected context and never changes result
                cardinality. Omit `hierarchy` entirely to retain the v0.2-compatible implicit
                source-grouped result shape.
            limit (int | Unset): Maximum number of top-level results to return. For semantic_search, this is the topk
                parameter.
                This does not limit nested matches attached through hierarchy.group_by.matches;
                use hierarchy.group_by.matches.limit for that. Default varies by query type (typically 10).
                Queries using hierarchy.group_by.matches are limited to 100 top-level groups
                and a groups-times-matches execution budget of 1,000.
                 Example: 20.
            offset (int | Unset): Number of results to skip for pagination. Supported for text-backed,
                match_all, and filter-only requests. Not supported for semantic_search
                due to vector index limitations.
            timeout_ms (int | Unset): Optional query execution deadline in milliseconds. The server applies this as a
                cooperative deadline across query planning, search execution, aggregation reruns,
                sorting, and response post-processing. If the deadline expires before the query
                completes, the HTTP API returns 504. When omitted, semantic query embedding planning
                and provider I/O use a 30-second default deadline.
                 Example: 5000.
            order_by (list[SortField] | Unset): Sort order for results. Array of sort fields with direction.
                Antfly appends `_id` ascending as a stable tie-breaker when it is omitted.
                Hierarchy child traversal requires `_hierarchy.position` ascending; its opaque,
                sortable value is bound to the complete source hierarchy revision.
                Supported for exact text-backed, match_all, and filter-only requests
                when each non-`_id` field is a mapped exact scalar field with sortable
                native doc-value coverage. Sortable mapping types are keyword,
                numeric/number/integer, boolean/bool, datetime/date/timestamp, and
                link. Declare the field with `x-antfly-field` and `sortable: true`;
                `x-antfly-types` shorthand declarations alone are not sortable.
                Analyzed `text` fields and `search_as_you_type`, geo, embedding,
                blob, html, object, and array fields are not directly sortable; sort
                on an exact scalar mapping such as `title.keyword` instead. Requests
                that cannot be executed through an exact native sort path return 422
                rather than falling back to stored JSON sorting. Semantic searches
                are always sorted by similarity score. Not supported when `count` is true.
                 Example: [{'field': 'created_at', 'desc': True}, {'field': 'score', 'desc': True}].
            search_after (list[Any] | Unset): Cursor for forward pagination. Pass the `_sort` values from the last hit
                of the previous page exactly, including the appended `_id` tie-breaker.
                Values preserve their JSON types; for example numbers remain numbers,
                booleans remain booleans, and strings remain strings. Cursor values
                must be replayable JSON scalars; nulls, arrays, objects, and non-finite
                numbers are rejected.
                Mutually exclusive with `offset`.
                When `order_by` is omitted, Antfly uses `_id` ascending as the effective
                order and the cursor tuple must contain exactly one `_id` string.
                Supported for exact text-backed, match_all, and filter-only requests;
                not supported for semantic_search or count-only requests.
                For hierarchy child traversal, a cursor whose source-artifact revision
                changed returns `409 hierarchy_cursor_stale`; restart the same traversal
                without `search_after` rather than retrying the stale tuple.
            search_before (list[Any] | Unset): Cursor for backward pagination. Pass the `_sort` values from the first hit
                of the current page exactly, including the appended `_id` tie-breaker.
                Values preserve their JSON types; for example numbers remain numbers,
                booleans remain booleans, and strings remain strings. Cursor values
                must be replayable JSON scalars; nulls, arrays, objects, and non-finite
                numbers are rejected.
                Mutually exclusive with `offset`.
                When `order_by` is omitted, Antfly uses `_id` ascending as the effective
                order and the cursor tuple must contain exactly one `_id` string.
                Supported for exact text-backed, match_all, and filter-only requests;
                not supported for semantic_search or count-only requests.
            distance_under (float | Unset): Maximum distance threshold for semantic similarity search. Results with distance
                greater than this value are excluded. Lower distances indicate higher similarity.

                Useful for filtering out low-confidence matches.
                 Example: 0.5.
            distance_over (float | Unset): Minimum distance threshold for semantic similarity search. Results with distance
                less than this value are excluded.

                Useful for excluding near-exact duplicates or finding dissimilar documents.
                 Example: 0.1.
            merge_config (MergeConfig | Unset): Configuration for result fusion when combining multiple search indexes.
            count (bool | Unset): If true, returns only the total count of matching documents without retrieving the actual
                documents.
                Useful for pagination and displaying result counts. Count-only requests
                do not return an ordered result page, so `order_by`, `search_after`,
                and `search_before` are not supported when this is true.
            profile (bool | Unset): If true, includes detailed execution profiling in the response.
                Adds a `profile` object with per-phase timing breakdowns, shard statistics,
                join metadata, reranker stats, and merge details.
                Has minor performance overhead — not recommended for production traffic.
            reranker (RerankerConfig | Unset): A unified configuration for a reranking provider. Example: {'provider':
                'ollama', 'model': 'dengcao/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B:F16', 'field': 'content'}.
            analyses (Analyses | Unset):
            graph_queries (GraphQueries | Unset): Named canonical graph operations. When graph_queries is present it must
                contain at least one operation. A request may contain at most 64 operations, of which at most eight may be MATCH
                operations. Keys use the versioned GraphIdentifier policy.
            document_renderer (str | Unset): Optional Handlebars template string for rendering document content in RAG
                queries.
                Template has access to document fields via `{{this.fields.fieldName}}`.

                **Default**: Uses TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format for 30-60% token reduction:
                ```handlebars
                {{encodeToon this.fields}}
                ```

                **Available Helpers**:
                - `encodeToon` - Renders fields in compact TOON format with configurable options:
                  - `lengthMarker` (bool): Add # prefix to array counts (default: true)
                  - `indent` (int): Indentation spacing (default: 2)
                  - `delimiter` (string): Field separator for tabular arrays
                - `scrubHtml` - Removes HTML tags and extracts text
                - `media` - Wraps data URIs for GenKit multimodal support
                - `eq` - Equality comparison for conditionals

                **Examples**:
                - Basic TOON: `{{encodeToon this.fields}}`
                - Compact TOON: `{{encodeToon this.fields lengthMarker=false indent=0}}`
                - Tabular data: `{{encodeToon this.fields delimiter="\t"}}`
                - Custom template: `Title: {{this.fields.title}}\nBody: {{this.fields.body}}`
                - Traditional format: `{{#each this.fields}}{{@key}}: {{this}}\n{{/each}}`

                TOON format produces compact, LLM-optimized output like:
                ```

                 Example: {{encodeToon this.fields}}.
            pruner (Pruner | Unset): Configuration for pruning search results based on score quality.
                Helps filter out low-relevance results in RAG pipelines by detecting
                score gaps or deviations from top results.
            join (JoinClause | Unset): Configuration for joining data from another table.
                Supports inner, left, and right joins with automatic strategy selection.
            foreign_sources (QueryRequestForeignSources | Unset): Map of table name to foreign data source configuration for
                query-time federated access.
                When a table name referenced in this query (or in a join's `right_table`) appears as a key
                here, the query is routed to the external database instead of Antfly shards.

                This enables joining Antfly search results with structured relational data (customer records,
                product catalogs, etc.) without ingesting that data into Antfly.

                **Supported operations on foreign tables:** filter_query, field selection, limit/offset.
                **Not supported:** full_text_search, semantic_search, graph_queries, aggregations, reranker.

                **Example - Join Antfly products with Postgres customers:**
                ```json
                {
                  "table": "products",
                  "full_text_search": {"query": "category:electronics"},
                  "join": {
                    "right_table": "pg_customers",
                    "on": {"left_field": "customer_id", "right_field": "id"}
                  },
                  "foreign_sources": {
                    "pg_customers": {
                      "type": "postgres",
                      "dsn": "${secret:pg_dsn}",
                      "postgres_table": "customers"
                    }
                  }
                }
                ```
            tree_search (TreeSearchConfig | Unset): Configuration for tree search strategy. Tree search navigates
                hierarchical
                document structures by evaluating summaries at each level.
