class GraphMatchQuery:
    """Conjunctive graph match over the complete authorized source universe. Top-level retrieval queries and filters do not
    scope that universe; put source constraints on the node named by match.anchor. Results are exact or the request
    fails; execution never labels a partial aggregate exact. Source anchors are streamed in stable snapshot-pinned pages
    and charged to the request-wide `scanned_anchors` work dimension; transient expansion state remains bounded, and
    execution observes request deadlines, cancellation, and server resource admission. Exact distinct identity sets are
    also bounded and fail closed when their request-scoped memory budget is exhausted.

        Attributes:
            index (str):
            match (GraphMatch): `anchor` names the alias enumerated from the query table as the source relation. Every other
                alias is reached through graph edges and may resolve to a table-qualified target identity. An `ids` filter, or a
                disjunction made only of `ids` filters, uses the table's primary identity access path and needs no secondary
                index. Stored-field predicates and row-level authorization filters on the anchor must have native index coverage
                so Antfly can enumerate the complete relation in `_id` order; otherwise the request fails with
                `graph_anchor_filter_requires_index`.
            return_ (GraphAggregatesReturn | GraphBindingsReturn): Return bindings or exact aggregates. Bindings and
                aggregates are mutually exclusive.
