            participant propagation is still completing. `committed_repair_required`
            means the primary write committed, but a terminal background materialization
            failure needs operator repair and will not be retried indefinitely. Inspect
            `failure` when present; retrying the document write is unnecessary.
        inserted (int | Unset): Number of documents successfully inserted
        deleted (int | Unset): Number of documents successfully deleted

        failure (BatchCommittedFailure | Unset): Additive details for a committed batch that needs operator action. The
            open string code is forward-compatible with older SDKs; clients should
            treat unknown codes as non-retryable when `retryable` is false.
