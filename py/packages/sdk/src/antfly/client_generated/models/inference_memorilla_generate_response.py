    """
    Attributes:
        model (str):
        text (str):
        token_ids (list[int]):
        finish_reason (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseFinishReason): Abstained is a policy-produced UNKNOWN answer.
            In source-verified mode it has empty token_ids and zero final completion tokens, and that mode never publishes a
            truncated factual answer. On encoder_lora_research and hybrid_research profiles it is produced by the answer
            guard (see answer_guard) and token_ids keep the decoder's output.
        input_documents (int):
        memory_tokens (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseMemoryTokens): Memory slots used by the published answer.
            Sixteen for latent or approved memory answers; zero for a source-text fallback or policy abstention. Source-
            verified mode still evaluates an initial memory candidate. hybrid_research reports 32 when the record gate
            opened (16 soft rows then 16 record rows) and 16 when it closed (soft rows only).
        context_source (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseContextSource): supplied_documents is reported by
            encoder_lora_research and hybrid_research profiles, which encoded caller-supplied texts server-side.
        encoder_execution_identity (str):
        decoder_execution_identity (str):
        memory_module_sha256 (str):
        usage (MemorillaGenerateUsage):
        candidate_sha256 (str | Unset): encoder_lora_research and hybrid_research profiles only. SHA256 of the research
            candidate.json pinned by the reader bundle and, for encoder_lora_research, by the merged encoder lock
            (hybrid_research instead checks that the candidate names the bundle's encoder-lora.safetensors digest); it
            identifies the experimental candidate, not a qualification status.
        answer_guard (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseAnswerGuard | Unset): encoder_lora_research and hybrid_research
            profiles only. Outcome of the answer guard applied to the decoder text. The research task answers are short
            exact facts (a name of a few words, a short code, or the literal UNKNOWN); text that is empty, longer than 64
            bytes, more than six words, contains control characters, the memory frame literal Memory as a standalone word or
            the <|memory|> marker, or bytes outside letters, digits, space, hyphen, period and apostrophe is rejected.
            hybrid_research answers general questions in sentences, so it applies only the frame-echo rules (empty text,
            control characters including newlines, the standalone word Memory, the <|memory|> marker). A rejected answer is
            published as text UNKNOWN with finish_reason abstained; token_ids keep what the decoder produced.
        citations (list[MemorillaCitation] | Unset): encoder_lora_research and hybrid_research profiles only. Where
            every span the copy head copied into the 16-slot memory record came from, one entry per contiguous cited region
            of a document, sorted by document_index then start. A copied run that crosses from one document into the next is
            split per document, and regions of one document that touch or overlap are merged. Empty when nothing was copied
            or when citations_unavailable is true, and on hybrid_research when record_gate is closed (the decoder then read
            only soft rows, which are not traceable to source bytes). A citation shows what the memory record copied, not
            proof that the answer is correct; supports_answer only reports whether the published answer text (on
            hybrid_research, after canonicalization) occurs in the cited region.
        citations_unavailable (bool | Unset): encoder_lora_research and hybrid_research profiles only. True when the
            encoder tokenizer's pieces did not reproduce the supplied texts byte for byte (for example Unicode normalization
            changed them), so copied tokens could not be mapped back to byte ranges; citations is then empty and the answer
            is unaffected.
        record_gate (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseRecordGate | Unset): hybrid_research profiles only. Open when at
            least one span the copy head copied into the record snapped every slot at cosine 0.85 or more; the decoder then
            read 32 rows under the merged prompt. Closed (no copied span, or every span carries a low-cosine slot) means the
            decoder read the 16 soft rows alone under the released helpful prompt.
        canonicalized (bool | Unset): hybrid_research profiles only. True when the published text was re-spelled from
            the record (record casing for a word-aligned case-insensitive match, or the full record word sequence for a
            dropped-prefix tail of at least three characters). Never true when the gate is closed or the answer is UNKNOWN.
        soft_module_sha256 (str | Unset): hybrid_research profiles only. SHA256 of the released reader weights that
            produced the soft rows (memory_module_sha256 is the research reader's).
        answer_path (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseAnswerPath | Unset): Present in source-verified mode and
            identifies the actual published answer path.
        verification_status (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseVerificationStatus | Unset): Model-supported means a
            completed verifier emitted the exact positive support label. It is a model judgment, not a formal entailment
            proof or a guarantee that caller-provided source facts are true.
        source_alignment (InferenceMemorillaGenerateResponseSourceAlignment | Unset): Source text and embedding row
            association was supplied by the caller; native embeddings are not recomputed to certify it.
        document_text_sha256s (list[str] | Unset): Source-verified mode only. SHA256 of each original UTF-8 source text,
            preserving row order; identifies supplied bytes, not source authority or selected supporting citations.
