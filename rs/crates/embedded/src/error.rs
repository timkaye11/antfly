//! Stable Antfly C ABI error codes.
//!
//! This mirrors `go/pkg/embedded/errors.go`: names and descriptions are
//! hand-maintained Rust values, not sourced from `antfly_error_code_name`/
//! `antfly_error_code_description` at runtime, so `Error` is usable (and its
//! `Display` output is meaningful) even when this crate is built without the
//! `libantfly` feature and no dylib is linked. `tests/errors.rs` (linked)
//! cross-checks these against the live C ABI.
