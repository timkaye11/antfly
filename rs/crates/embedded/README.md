# antfly-embedded

Safe Rust binding for Antfly Lite, the embedded `libantfly` C ABI. It wraps
that ABI's `antfly_db` handle, so applications embed a live database
directly instead of talking to the network SDK (`antfly-sdk`) -- either a
single-file `.aflite` database (the default, [`Storage::Lite`]) or a normal
Antfly directory ([`Storage::Directory`]), selected on [`OpenOptions`].

This crate mirrors the reference Go binding (`go/pkg/embedded`) idiomatically:
[`Database`] is a `Send + Sync` handle safe for concurrent use from any
thread, most operations are exposed as `*_json` methods that take request
bytes and return response bytes (the same wire-level JSON contract shared
with the Antfly server API and the other language bindings), and a
default-on `serde` feature layers typed convenience wrappers (`Status`,
`Capabilities`, `CheckReport`, ...) on top.

## Example

```rust,no_run
use antfly_embedded::{Database, OpenOptions, WriteIntent};

fn main() -> Result<(), antfly_embedded::Error> {
    let db = Database::create("my.aflite", &OpenOptions::new())?;
    db.batch(&[WriteIntent::put("doc:1", r#"{"title":"hello","body":"world"}"#)], 1)?;
    db.run_until_idle()?;
    let doc = db.lookup_json("doc:1")?;
    let hits = db.search_json(
        r#"{"full_text_search":{"match":{"field":"body","text":"world"}},"limit":5}"#,
    )?;
    println!("{}\n{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&doc), String::from_utf8_lossy(&hits));
    Ok(())
}
```

Every thread that calls into a `Database` needs at least
`antfly_embedded::MIN_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` (8 MiB) of stack. The main thread has
that on Linux and macOS, but Rust's spawned threads default to 2 MiB, so
size them explicitly:

```rust,no_run
# use std::sync::Arc;
# fn run(db: Arc<antfly_embedded::Database>) {
std::thread::Builder::new()
    .stack_size(antfly_embedded::MIN_THREAD_STACK_SIZE)
    .spawn(move || db.stats_json())
    .unwrap();
# }
```

Async runtimes need the same for the threads that make these blocking
calls, for example Tokio's `thread_stack_size` on the runtime builder.

## Building against `libantfly`

Install `pkg-config`, extract the Apache `antfly-embedded` release archive,
and add its `lib/pkgconfig` directory to `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. Enable the
`libantfly` Cargo feature to link the combined database and inference library:

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/antfly-embedded/lib/pkgconfig${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:+:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
cargo build --features antfly-embedded/libantfly
```

The sys crate tries an explicit `ANTFLY_LIB_DIR` first, then pkg-config,
then `zig/zig-out/lib` in a source checkout. The library must remain installed
when the app runs. Crate tests/examples receive runtime search paths;
downstream application binaries should install the library in the system
loader path or set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS)
to the archive's `lib` directory, or configure their own rpath.
No ELv2 server package is required. See the sys crate README for discovery
and cross-compilation details. Native archive targets are independent of the
Python/npm package matrix, which currently covers Linux x86-64 and ARM64
(glibc 2.28+) and macOS ARM64.

Source checkout tests:

```sh
cd zig && zig build capi   # or: zig build, for the full antfly CLI
cd ../rs
cargo test -p antfly-embedded --features libantfly
```

Outside the source tree, set `ANTFLY_LIB_DIR` to point at an installed
`libantfly`'s `lib` directory.


Pkg-config resolves the archive's current installation directory when you
build. These crates' test/example binaries receive an absolute runtime search
path; downstream applications follow their own loader configuration. If a
binary uses the archive directory as its rpath, moving the archive afterward
requires rebuilding that binary or configuring the system loader. Distribution
packages should install the library into the final system prefix, remove the
`-Wl,-rpath,${libdir}` flag from `libantfly.pc` for C/Go consumers, and configure
application binaries according to the distribution's loader policy.

### Embedded inference

`libantfly` always links the standalone inference runtime in-process, the
same as the `antfly` executable. Setting `local_runtime_configured` on
[`OpenOptions`] yields `local_embedded` behavior: an embedded model runtime
that runs chunker, embedder, and extractor producers configured with
`"provider": "antfly"` and no `api_url` locally instead of failing or
requiring a remote URL.

**In-process, every backend.** `libantfly` runs every inference backend,
including Metal, CUDA, and ONNX, in the calling process -- there is no
separate worker process, and `ANTFLY_INFERENCE_WORKER` is not used. The
`antfly` server instead runs those backends in a worker process it can kill
and restart, because a GPU driver call or an ONNX model load has no
per-call abort; a library cannot do that to its host program, so
`libantfly` accepts the trade SQLite makes: once a call reaches the device
or driver it runs to completion (`call_timeout_ms`/[`InferenceOptions::call_timeout`],
and closing a handle, take effect only when it returns; calls on CPU
backends still stop cooperatively), and a GPU driver fault terminates the
process. See `zig/CAPI.md`'s "Inference In Process" section for the full
detail.

### Embedded inference without a database

For typed decision requests and answer semantics, see the
[decision guide](../../../docs/guides/decisions.md).

[`Inference`] opens the same embedded inference runtime on its own, with no
database -- `Inference::open`/`open_default` (options: [`InferenceOptions`],
covering models directory, resource budgets, and a per-call timeout) and
`close`. It mirrors `Database`'s handle-safety story (`Send + Sync`, close
waits for in-flight calls, idempotent, safe from any thread).

Each method mirrors one `/ai/v1` route of the inference HTTP API and takes/
returns raw JSON bytes: `embed`, `rerank`, `chunk`, `generate`,
`generate_batch`, `rewrite`, `decide`, `extract`, `read` (OCR), `transcribe`, and
`list_models`. Unlike `Database`'s `*_json` methods, these return
[`InferenceResult<Vec<u8>>`] on failure: [`InferenceError`] carries both the
mapped [`Error`] and the runtime's JSON error body
(`{"error":...,"message":...}`), since `antfly_inference_*_json` calls are
documented to always leave one behind.

```rust,no_run
use antfly_embedded::{Inference, InferenceOptions};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let inference = Inference::open(&InferenceOptions::new())?;
    let chunks = inference.chunk(r#"{"input":"Ants live in colonies. Workers gather food."}"#)?;
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&chunks));
    Ok(())
}
```

**Streaming generation.** `generate` always returns a complete response --
a request with `"stream": true` fails with `Error::InvalidArgument`. Use
`Inference::generate_stream` to stream instead: it sets `"stream": true`
for you and calls `on_chunk` on the calling thread for each
`chat.completion.chunk` JSON chunk as the model produces tokens.

```rust,no_run
# use antfly_embedded::{Inference, InferenceOptions};
# fn run(inference: &Inference) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let mut on_chunk = |chunk: &[u8]| {
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(chunk));
    true // keep going; return false to stop generating early
};
inference.generate_stream(
    r#"{"model":"owner/name","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}"#,
    &mut on_chunk,
)?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

`on_chunk` is a rendezvous -- generation waits for each call to return
before producing the next chunk -- so returning `false` always stops
generation at that chunk, and the call fails with `Error::Cancelled`
(wrapped in `InferenceError`). A pre-stream failure (for example a missing
model) fails like `generate`, with the JSON error attached; a mid-stream
failure fails with `Error::Internal` and a JSON body naming
`"STREAM_FAILED"`.

**Pulling models.** `Inference::pull` downloads a model into the handle's
models directory (like `antfly inference pull`), with an optional progress
callback called synchronously on the calling thread as each file starts,
every 16 MiB, and as it completes:

```rust,no_run
# use antfly_embedded::{Inference, InferenceOptions, PullProgress};
# fn run(inference: &Inference) -> antfly_embedded::InferenceResult<()> {
let mut on_progress = |p: &PullProgress| {
    println!("{}: {}/{} bytes", p.file, p.bytes_downloaded, p.total_bytes);
    true // keep going; return false to cancel the pull
};
inference.pull(r#"{"model":"owner/name"}"#, Some(&mut on_progress))?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Returning `false` cancels the pull -- the call fails with `Error::Cancelled`
and the model is not installed. The progress callback is a rendezvous (the
download waits for each call to return before continuing), so cancellation
is always honored at the report where `on_progress` returns `false`, even
at the very last report of the last file. Completed files stay staged, so
pulling the same model again resumes rather than restarts. `Inference::close`
waits for a pull (or a stream) in progress; neither is cancelled by `close`
itself.

A panic inside `on_chunk`/`on_progress` is caught and does not unwind
across the C ABI boundary (unwinding through `extern "C"` is undefined
behavior): it cancels the call and is resumed once the underlying FFI call
returns.

## Thread safety

`Database` is `Send + Sync` and safe for concurrent use from any thread,
like `*sql.DB` in Go: share one handle rather than opening one per thread.
`libantfly` runs in serialized threading mode
(`threading_mode() == THREADING_SERIALIZED`): reads such as `search_json`,
`lookup_json`, and `scan_json` run in parallel with each other and with
writes, `batch` and transaction calls on one handle queue instead of failing
with `Busy`, and schema or index changes wait for in-flight calls.

`close` takes `&self`, not `self` by value, specifically so it can be called
on a `Database` shared across threads (e.g. `Arc<Database>`) without every
other clone having to be dropped first -- calls made after (or racing) close
return `Error::InvalidArgument` rather than touching a freed handle.
`Drop` also closes, for callers who never need to close early. Both are
idempotent and safe to call concurrently or more than once.

Internally, `Database` gates calls through a small hand-rolled
reader/writer lock rather than `std::sync::RwLock`: `std`'s `RwLock` makes
no fairness guarantees, and on platforms like macOS a steady stream of
readers can starve a pending writer indefinitely, which would make `close`
hang under sustained concurrent read load. The internal gate instead blocks
*new* reads once a close is requested (like Go's `sync.RWMutex`), guaranteeing
close completes in bounded time.

Only one writer handle may be open per file at a time, across processes. Set
`OpenOptions::busy_timeout` to wait for another writer to close instead of
failing immediately with `Busy`, like `sqlite3_busy_timeout`.

## API surface

- `Database::open`/`create` (with [`OpenOptions`]), plus `open_default`,
  `create_default`, `open_readonly`, `open_status_only`, `open_hosted`, and
  `create_hosted` convenience constructors.
- Raw `*_json` methods take `impl AsRef<[u8]>` and return `Vec<u8>`, matching
  the C ABI's JSON contract 1:1: `batch_json`, `lookup_json`, `get_raw`,
  `scan_json`, `search_json`, the packed wire search variants, schema/index/
  enrichment administration, graph queries, transactions, and maintenance
  (backup/export/import, check, compact, vacuum, stable snapshots).
- With the default `serde` feature, typed convenience methods
  (`status`, `capabilities`, `check`, `vacuum`, `compact`,
  `copy_stable_snapshot`, `pending_work_stats`, ...) parse those JSON
  payloads into typed structs, returning `TypedResult<T>` (an FFI error or a
  JSON decode error).
- `restore`/`restore_file` stage a portable `.afb` backup into a new
  database, of the storage kind `RestoreOptions::storage` selects (a
  backup of either kind restores into either kind); `Database::backup`/
  `backup_to_file` produce one, and `Database::import_backup` imports one
  directly into an empty, already-open handle.
- `Inference::open`/`open_default` (with [`InferenceOptions`]) open an
  embedded inference runtime with no database; `embed`, `rerank`, `chunk`,
  `generate`, `generate_batch`, `rewrite`, `decide`, `extract`, `read`, `transcribe`,
  `list_models`, and `pull` mirror the `/ai/v1` inference HTTP API 1:1.
  `generate_stream` streams a generate request chunk by chunk, and both it
  and `pull` accept a callback that can cancel the call by returning
  `false`, surfaced as `Error::Cancelled`. See "Embedded inference without a
  database" above.

See the crate's rustdoc for the full method list.

## Testing

- `cargo test -p antfly-embedded` (no feature) runs only pure, non-linking
  tests (`tests/pure.rs`) -- value types, error name/description tables,
  and a compile-time `Database: Send + Sync` assertion. It needs no dylib.
- `cargo test -p antfly-embedded --features libantfly` additionally runs:
  - `tests/errors.rs`: cross-checks `Error`'s names/descriptions against the
    live `antfly_error_code_name`/`antfly_error_code_description`, plus ABI
    validation and struct-size checks.
  - `tests/concurrency.rs`: a handle shared by threads doing batch/search/
    scan/lookup/stats/run-until-idle concurrently, close racing in-flight
    calls, and `busy_timeout` behavior.
  - `tests/conformance.rs`: runs every case under
    `zig/pkg/antfly-embedded/capi-conformance/cases/*.json` (see that directory's
    README), the same declarative suite every language binding runs, plus a
    standalone test that restores a backup into directory storage and
    reopens it.
  - `tests/inference.rs`: `Inference::open`/`open_default`, chunk/embed/
    generate/generate_stream/pull error mapping (including the JSON error
    body carried on `InferenceError` and `Error::Cancelled` from a
    cancelled `generate_stream`/`pull`), use-after-close and double-close,
    plus preconditioned tests that skip rather than fail when unmet:
    embedding with a locally installed `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF*`
    model, streaming/cancelling generation with a locally installed
    `ggml-org/gemma-4-e2b-it-gguf*` model, and pulling a real model from
    the network (including cancelling on the first progress report, which
    reliably fails with `Error::Cancelled` and leaves the model uninstalled)
    when `ANTFLY_INFERENCE_PULL_TEST_MODEL` is set.

Some conformance/concurrency cases (full-text search under concurrent write
pressure) need substantially more native stack than a typical fixed-size OS
thread gets by default; these tests run their bodies on an explicitly
large-stack thread rather than relying on the test harness's default.
