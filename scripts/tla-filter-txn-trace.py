"""Filter antfly-trace ndjson to keep only transactions with TLA+ spec-compatible lifecycles.

The AntflyTransaction TLA+ spec models these txnStatus transitions:
  idle → preparing (InitTransaction)
  preparing → predicatesChecked (CheckPredicates)
  predicatesChecked → predicatesChecked (WriteIntentOnShard, no status change)
  predicatesChecked → aborting (WriteIntentFails)
  predicatesChecked → committed (CommitTransaction)
  aborting → aborted (AbortTransaction)
  committed/aborted → (ResolveIntentsOnShard, CleanupTxnRecord)

Events from recovery tests, retries, or external aborts don't match the spec.
They and every transaction in their key-connected component are dropped: a
modeled transaction can otherwise depend on an omitted writer or live intent.
Independent incomplete-but-valid prefixes are kept (CHECK_DEADLOCK FALSE).

Usage:
