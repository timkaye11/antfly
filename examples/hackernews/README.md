# Hacker News example

This example runs historical Hacker News search with GCS-backed Parquet and
Antfly index artifacts using a local standalone process. It uses the existing
`colony-import-sources-antfly-dev-01` bucket in `us-central1`; all objects expire
after eight days. A durable deployment needs separate managed storage.

## Export a bounded sample

`export.sql` selects the latest 10,000 live stories/comments within September
2025, not a complete month. Change the export prefix before another export and
dry-run the SELECT first. On October 7 the public source had 49,949,001 rows and
19,754,132,371 logical bytes. LIMIT bounds output, not the BigQuery scan cost.

```sh
bq --project_id=antfly-dev-01 --location=US query \
  --use_legacy_sql=false --maximum_bytes_billed=21474836480 \
  --label=purpose:hn_lake_poc < examples/hackernews/export.sql
```

The raw BigQuery export uses standard Snappy Parquet with DataPageV1, dictionary
encoding and plain fallback pages. Its dictionary headers use the deprecated
`PLAIN_DICTIONARY` label; Antfly now accepts that label as well as `PLAIN`.
The untouched export passed this check after the compatibility fix.

`normalize.py` is optional: it decodes HTML/entities and writes DataPageV2
Parquet. This converter materializes the sample in memory; larger backfills need
a streaming converter. Keep `hn_id` for HN links. `parent_id` identifies the
immediate parent, which may be another comment; root-story resolution is future
ingestion work.

## Run the check

Build a standalone binary with the allocator, Parquet, filter and cache fixes.
The GCS allocator fix is [PR #1009](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/pull/1009).
Without it, parallel GCS metadata reads can crash because transport responses
are allocated and freed with different allocators.

```sh
python3 examples/hackernews/poc.py \
  --binary /path/to/antfly \
  --state /private/tmp/hackernews-state \
  --prefix hn-poc/20261007 \
  --require-filters
```

Use a fresh local state directory when changing sources. The checker starts a
loopback-only process, creates `hn_archive_poc`, waits for publication, checks
10,000 SQL rows, ranked search, projected highlights, snapshot pagination, exact
HN-ID filtering with score ordering, and score/cursor stability after restart.
It stops the process and writes `report.json` into the state directory.

The checker obtains a short-lived token from the current gcloud identity and
passes it only through the child environment. Configuration contains
`${secret:HN_GCS_BEARER}` rather than a credential. This authentication is for the
smoke check; a service needs its own credential flow. Source and artifact
connections have separate prefix allowlists and capabilities (`lake_read` and
`storage.primary`). Existing human IAM grants are used. Index artifacts are in
`<prefix>/indexes`; catalog state and the configured 1 GiB cache are local.

## October 7 results

`qualification.json` records observations from a local Debug build against GCS.

| 10,000-row sample | First highlighted query | Repeat | After restart | Exact ordered filter |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Normalized, allocator fix only | 26.4 s | 17.8 s | 27.5 s | Rejected; unordered timed out |
| Same normalized file, follow-up fixes | 22.3 s | 468 ms | 20.0 s | Passed |
| Untouched BigQuery export, follow-up fixes | 13.7 s | 452 ms | 15.3 s | Passed |

Search previously cached inventory metadata but never attached the Parquet range
cache for hydration. Attaching it removes repeated remote reads on warm queries.
First-query and restart latency still need work: the configured disk-cache
directory contained no persisted range files. The first query follows index
publication, so it is not a guaranteed cold-cache measurement. Readiness timing
on an existing publication is not index-build timing. These results do not
establish full-archive capacity or concurrent production latency.

A separate raw-export check also passed the previously timed-out unordered
HN-ID filter in 481 ms.

Flat structured predicates now scan only their required columns against the
pinned, delete-aware lake snapshot and resolve IDs before ranking/pagination.
This preserves exact integer comparisons and works when predicate fields are
absent from the result projection or text index. Match sets are bounded at
100,000 IDs; nested paths retain the existing residual-filter path. Full-archive
filtering needs indexed predicate evaluation rather than a full-source scan.

## Remaining deployment work

- Diagnose persistent cache initialization/writes and reduce cold GCS read fanout.
- Qualify larger partitions against build/corpus limits and indexed filtering.
- Define durable buckets and service identities through Colony's infra workflow.
- Stream backfills, resolve parent stories, and reconcile edits/deletions.
- Build Recent/Historical routing and the public search interface.
