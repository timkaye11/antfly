# Long-context teacher (step 2a) — raw run log

2026-09-26, Apple M4 Max (36 GiB, shared with ~8 other agents). Supports
[LAYA.md, "Long-context teacher (step 2a)"](../../../../zig/pkg/inference/models/laya/LAYA.md#long-context-teacher-step-2a).
Branch `laya/long-context-teacher`, base commit `9d9627ec3e`.

## Environment

- Teacher: `mlx-community/Qwen3-14B-4bit`, downloaded via `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`
  (7.8 GB) to `.tmp/laya/qwen3-14b-4bit`. No local build needed (`mlx-lm` ships
  prebuilt wheels for macOS/arm64).
- Ran under the shared GPU lock (`with-lock gpu`), one bounded batch per
  invocation. Actual queueing observed: several runs waited 5-25 minutes for
  other agents' training/eval jobs to release the lock before starting; this
  is expected under ~9 concurrent agents and is not teacher cost.
- Script: `scripts/laya/prepare_laya_longcontext_teacher.py` (new).

## Eligibility check (which records Laya truly cannot see)

`prepare_laya_finetune.py`'s 316-raw-token cutoff is a global worst case;
re-checking against the exact `state_fits` budget (which depends on how many
labels a specific question has) found far fewer truly-invisible records than
the cutoff's superset:

```
eval:        160 candidates (>316 raw tokens) -> 34 truly invisible (21%)
train:       425 candidates                   -> 69 truly invisible (16%)
calibration: 145 candidates                   -> ~31 truly invisible (21%, inferred:
                                                   all fell in the "choice" bucket;
                                                   0 for score/noul)
```

Qwen tokenizer length check on the 425 `train` long-candidates: min/median/p90/max
= 320 / 375 / 473 / 549 tokens. All comfortably inside Qwen3-14B's 40,960-token
native context.

## Memory footprint

```
/usr/bin/time -l uv run --script scripts/laya/prepare_laya_longcontext_teacher.py \
    td/s0-eval.jsonl --score-all --compare-laya --limit 300 --seed 20260925 ...
        439.15 real       137.33 user        87.16 sys
     8935194624  maximum resident set size   (8.94 GB)
       10502528  peak memory footprint (mach task_info; smaller metric, not RSS)
```

8.94 GB RSS is well under the ~18 GB bound, with room to spare on the shared
36 GB machine.

## Timing

| Run | Decisions scored | Candidates | seconds/decision | Prompt tokens |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `eval-long` (+ calibration fit) | 34 | 160 | 1.826 | 21,745 |
| `train-long` | 69 | 425 | 1.929 | 44,050 |
| `short-state` (s0-eval sample) | 300 | 300 (`--score-all`) | 1.127 | 104,890 |

Each run held the GPU lock under 8 minutes of active compute (excluding queue
wait for other agents). Per-label cost after the first (prompt) forward per
record was 30-60 ms via the branched KV cache, against ~2 s for a full
prompt-length forward — confirms the cache branch (`KVCache.state` snapshot
and restore) does not force a re-encode.

## Full metrics JSON

Preserved from the actual runs (paths are under the producing worktree's `.tmp/laya/`,
not committed):

- `eval-long-metrics.json` — 34 long decisions, `--compare-laya`, calibration
  fit on `calibration-long.jsonl` (145 candidates -> temperatures `{"choice":
  3.9939209720620426, "score": 1.0, "noul": 1.0}`).
- `train-long-metrics.json` — 69 long decisions, `--compare-laya`, reused the
  eval-long temperatures via `--temperatures`.
- `short-state-metrics.json` — 300 short decisions (`s0-eval.jsonl` sample,
  seed 20260925), `--score-all --compare-laya`, reused the same temperatures.

Combined long-state metrics (34 + 69 = 103 decisions, decision-weighted mean):

| Metric | teacher_uncalibrated | teacher_calibrated | laya_teacher |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| accuracy | 0.7670 | 0.7670 | 0.2913 |
| soft_ce | 4.6452 | 3.4912 | 1.4243 |
| ece | 0.2341 | 0.2481 | 0.1998 |

`laya_teacher` on the 300-decision short-state sample: accuracy 0.3933,
soft_ce 1.3114, ece 0.1517 — matches the released zero-shot unpacked numbers
in LAYA.md's Accuracy (step 0) table (0.387 / 1.308 / 0.158 on the full 760),
a useful cross-check that this script's Laya-baseline path (upstream
`build_sequence` + `DecisionModel`, reused from
`prepare_laya_packed_distillation.py`) reproduces the documented reference.

```

## Open items (as of the first pass, resolved below)

- `score`/`noul` calibration had zero truly-invisible examples in the
  `calibration.jsonl` split, so their temperatures are unfit (default 1.0).
  Needs a bigger long-state calibration pool — step 2c's 8k-token states
  should supply one.
- Length-normalized log-likelihood (average log-prob/token) was used to
  compare labels of different token counts; not verified against an
  un-normalized (raw sum) alternative.
- No option-count bucketing of temperature (Laya's own config buckets by
  `type:count`); a single per-type temperature was used given the small
  calibration pool.

## Recalibration (v2): full calibration split, bucketed temperatures, score-mode comparison

2026-09-26, same machine. The coordinator flagged that the first pass's poor
soft CE looked like a calibration-sample-size artifact (temperatures were fit
only on the ~31 calibration examples that happened to be long-state-invisible,
leaving `score`/`noul` unfit at `1.0`), not a real teacher weakness, since the
teacher can score every calibration record regardless of whether Laya could
see its state. Addressed by:

1. **Calibration no longer filters by Laya eligibility.** `--calibration` now
   scores every record in the given file. Used the full `td/calibration.jsonl`
   (1,000 records: 300 `choice`, 400 `score`, 300 `noul`) instead of the
   145-record long-only subset.
2. **Bucketed temperature fitting**, `option_bucket()` + `fit_temperatures_bucketed()`
   in `prepare_laya_longcontext_teacher.py`: a temperature per (type,
   option-count bucket) with >=15 calibration examples, falling back to a
   per-type temperature otherwise. On this dataset every type has exactly one
   bucket (`choice:3-5`, `score:3-5`, `noul:2`), so bucket-level and type-level
   temperatures coincide here; the machinery is in place for a dataset (e.g.
   Banking77-style candidate mode) that varies option count within a type.
3. **Raw-sum vs. length-normalized comparison**, `--score-mode auto`: both
   conventions come from the same per-token logprobs (score_record now returns
   both), so comparing them costs nothing extra. Fit separately on the full
   calibration split and compared mean cross-entropy:

   | Score mode | Mean CE on calibration (n=1,000) |
   | --- | ---: |
   | raw-sum | **1.0149** |
   | length-normalized | 1.0199 |

   Raw-sum wins, narrowly (0.5% relative). Fitted temperatures (raw-sum, the
   chosen mode): `choice` 14.48, `score` 12.94, `noul` 27.26 — an order of
   magnitude larger than the first pass's `choice: 3.99`, expected since
   raw-sum log-likelihoods scale with label token count and so need more
   softening than the length-normalized (per-token) scores the first pass used.

### Rerun note: a crash mid-run

The first recalibration attempt (`eval-long` + calibration fit) was in flight
when the machine crashed; the process died before writing any output (the
script's atomic tempfile-then-hardlink write pattern means a crash never
produces a partial/corrupt `--output` or `--metrics-output` file — confirmed
nothing existed at that path afterward). Rerun from scratch below.

### Updated results

Same three runs as the first pass (`eval-long`, `train-long` reusing the
fitted temperatures, and a 300-decision `s0-eval.jsonl` sample), rescored with
the new calibration:

| Split | Decisions | Teacher accuracy | Teacher soft CE | Teacher ECE | Laya accuracy | Laya soft CE | Laya ECE |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `eval-long` | 34 | 0.706 | 0.972 | 0.159 | 0.265 | 1.382 | 0.235 |
| `train-long` | 69 | 0.797 | 0.984 | 0.270 | 0.304 | 1.445 | 0.182 |
| long, combined | 103 | 0.767 | 0.980 | 0.233 | 0.291 | 1.424 | 0.200 |
| short (`s0-eval` sample) | 300 | 0.640 | 1.018 | 0.104 | 0.393 | 1.311 | 0.152 |

Against the first pass's combined long-state numbers (accuracy 0.767 unchanged
— temperature scaling does not move the argmax; soft CE 3.491 -> 0.980, a
3.6x improvement; ECE 0.248 -> 0.233, a small improvement) and short-state
numbers (soft CE 4.603 -> 1.018, ECE 0.273 -> 0.104): the teacher now beats
Laya on every metric except long-state ECE (0.233 vs. 0.200, `choice`
specifically: 0.323 vs. 0.166). Full metrics JSON: `eval-long-metrics-v2.json`,
`train-long-metrics-v2.json`, `short-state-metrics-v2.json` (paths under the
producing worktree's `.tmp/laya/`, not committed). Memory unchanged: 8.94 GB
peak RSS (`/usr/bin/time -l`, short-state run).

```

Queueing was severe during this recalibration pass: the first `eval-long` run
above waited roughly 3.5 hours for the GPU lock, cycling through several other
agents' back-to-back training/eval jobs before acquiring it (visible as a
rapidly incrementing holder pid in `gpu.lock`, consistent with a wrapper
script that re-acquires the lock immediately after releasing it, leaving an
external 5-second poller little chance to win the race). This is a
lock-fairness gap worth flagging to whoever owns `with-lock`, not a cost of
the teacher itself; the two follow-up runs queued a few minutes each.

## Open items (updated)

- Resolved: calibration now uses the full 1,000-record split and both score
  modes were compared; raw-sum adopted.
- Still open: this dataset exercises only one option-count bucket per
  question type, so `fit_temperatures_bucketed`'s per-bucket path is
  implemented but untested against a within-type spread (Banking77's
  candidate-mode 77-option case would exercise it).
- Long-state `choice` ECE (0.323) still trails Laya's tuned calibration
  (0.166); not blocking given the accuracy and soft-CE gap in the teacher's
  favor, but worth another look if step 2c needs tighter calibration.
- The GPU-lock queueing behavior observed above (near-starvation against a
  tight training/eval loop) may be worth a fix independent of this track.
