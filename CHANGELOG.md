# Changelog

All notable changes to Antfly will be documented in this file.

## Roadmap

### 0.3.x

- **SQL and the Postgres wire protocol** — DDL and DML over Antfly tables, a `psql`-compatible server, and a REPL
- **Relational storage** — closed schemas with foreign keys and PostgreSQL-compatible types, with full-text, vector, sparse, graph, and algebraic indexes derived over the same rows
- **Lake tables** — Iceberg and Parquet queried in place over object storage
- **Graph analytics** — PageRank and eigenvector centrality in graph indexes
- **Build system** — shorter compile times and lower build memory

## Releases

### [Unreleased]

- **`antfly standby` replaces `antfly ha`** — the hot-standby command is
  renamed; `antfly ha` remains a hidden alias for one minor release. It gains
  `--data-dir` (opens the node's standby state under `<dir>/ha/` and reads the
  log identity from the files), `--config` (reads the server's `hot_standby`
  section), unprefixed flags (`--admin-url`, `--admin-token-env`,
  `--cluster-id`, ...; the `--ha-*` spellings remain aliases), and
  `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_URL` / `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN` defaults (the
  `ANTFLY_HA_*` names are read as fallbacks). The `--` separator before the
  verb is optional. Help text rewritten.
- **`hot_standby:` config section** — `antfly standalone --config` fills any
  `--ha-*` flag it was not given from
  `hot_standby.{admin,identity,primary,standby,sync,retention}`; flags still
  win. The deprecated `ha:` key is still read for one minor release.
- **Admin API moved to `/admin/v1/standby/...` and `/standby/v1/...`**, and the
  internal replication API to `/internal/v1/standby/replication/...`. The
  standby-role routes drop their now-redundant segment (`/standby/status`,
  `/standby/bootstrap`, `/standby/upstream`). The old `/admin/v1/ha/...`,
  `/ha/v1/...`, and `/internal/v1/ha/...` paths are served as aliases for one
  minor release, and the CLI and a replicating standby fall back to them once
  when they meet a 0.2 server, so either side of a pair may be upgraded first.
  The Kubernetes operator negotiates per server (`--standby-admin-path-style`,
  default `auto`) instead of waiting for a minimum server version, and reads
  its own token from `ANTFLY_STANDBY_ADMIN_TOKEN` before `ANTFLY_HA_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
- **Schemas renamed `HA*` -> `Standby*`** — in the admin and internal OpenAPI
  specs and the generated SDKs. The Go SDK keeps every `HA*` name as a
  deprecated alias, adds `PathStyleAuto` (canonical first, one fallback to the
  old spelling, remembered per base URL), and keeps the legacy style as its
  zero-value default for this release.
- **Operator metrics** — dual-emitted under both the `ha` and `standby`
  subsystems during the deprecation window.
- **`antfly standalone --hot-standby-*` flags** replace `--ha-*`:
  `--ha-standby-X` becomes `--hot-standby-X` (`--hot-standby-log`,
  `--hot-standby-progress`, ...), `--ha-primary-X` becomes
  `--hot-standby-primary-X`, and every other `--ha-X` becomes
  `--hot-standby-X`. The `--ha-*` spellings remain aliases for one minor
  release; the operator keeps generating them for now.
- **Data directory `standby/`** — `antfly standby --data-dir` now looks for
  `standby/{primary.wal,slots,log.wal,progress.wal,fence.wal}` and falls back
  to the pre-0.3 `ha/` tree. The server migrates an `ha/` tree to `standby/`
  once at startup when its flags point at the new tree (directory rename plus
  `standby.wal` -> `log.wal`, `standby-progress.wal` -> `progress.wal`; nothing
  is deleted or overwritten). The operator switches a cluster's default pod
  paths to `/antflydb/standby/` once it has seen the cluster's nodes speak the
  0.3 admin API and records the choice in `status.haStatus.dataLayout`; new
  clusters start on `standby/`.
- **Server metrics `antfly_standby_*`** — every `antfly_ha_*` series is also
  emitted under the new name for one minor release.
- **OpenAPI tags and config schemas** — tags `standby` / `standby-replication`;
  `HotStandbyPrimaryConfig` / `HotStandbyStandbyConfig`.
- **`storage/hot_standby` package** — the Zig package moved from
  `storage/ha`, the command source from `cmd/ha.zig` to `cmd/standby.zig`, and
  the root alias from `antfly.ha` to `antfly.hot_standby`; test names and
  build steps are `storage.hot_standby ...`, `standby cmd ...`, and
  `antfly-storage-hot-standby-*`.
- **Planned switchover** — `antfly standby switchover --to <standby>` fences the
  old primary first, waits for the standby to reach the final LSN, fences and
  promotes the standby with the same fence generation, assesses the old
  primary's rejoin (reseed applied immediately, rewind pending its restart as
  a standby), and repoints `--follower` standbys.
- **`antfly standby follow`** and `POST /admin/v1/standby/upstream` — repoint a
  running standby at a new primary without a restart, guarded by an expected
  identity precondition; idempotent on retry. Also fixes a race where the
  replication round read its upstream config outside the standby state mutex.
- **Fence generation allocation** — `POST /admin/v1/standby/fence` no longer
  requires `generation`; without a Kubernetes Lease authority the node
  allocates the next generation, and an identical omitted-generation retry
  returns the held receipt instead of double-fencing.
- The `ha cmd` test root now runs all of its tests (the filter previously ran
  7 of 35); tests that wrote to stdout under the build runner were the cause
  of a hung `zig build`.

- Relational packed base-row storage lands behind the relational table profile
- HBC vector LSM replaced with native WAL-backed generations
- Self-contained deterministic VOPR testing, with production HA promotion and scaling composed in simulation against retained corpora
- Bounded multimodal document processing in inference
- Homebrew version resolution and macOS dylib relocation made reliable
- Docs for the v0.2 launch rebuilt on one scaffold with facts re-verified against `main`

### [0.2.1] - 2026-09-08

Not just a patch release. v0.2.1 fills in parts of the v0.2.0 release that shipped rough or missing, on top of a long list of bug fixes found in the first weeks of the Zig runtime in production.

#### Highlights

- **Hot-standby HA** — standalone mode now has a Postgres-style hot standby with fenced promotion, a lower-cost alternative to Raft replication. Supported end to end by the operator and CLI, and chaos tested for weeks @bpopadiuk
- **Generated GPU kernels** — a Triton-style quant-kernel JIT now generates our CUDA and Metal kernels, accelerating Gemma 4, BGE-M3, and GLiNER2 while cutting the number of hand-maintained quantization types @timkaye11
- **Qwen3 across the board** — Metal and CUDA support for Qwen3-Embedding and Qwen3-VL; Qwen3 is now the suggested embedder, reranker, and multimodal reranker, with a q8_0 bundle in the quickstart sized for a laptop @timkaye11
- **PDFs, properly** — native rendering, OCR handoff, whitespace reconstruction, JBIG2 and JPEG 2000 decoding, and ParseBench-guided parser fixes, validated against benchmark corpora @dovinmu
- **Benchmarked** — graph, full-text, and vector index behavior benchmarked extensively, and many of the metrics you care about improved as a result. A release "model card" with our evaluation suite is coming @dovinmu
- **Structured graph query DSL** — a Cypher-like DSL covering a large subset of Cypher functionality, with much faster exact pattern queries
- **Multi-source vector indexes** — index multiple fields with the same embedding type into a single index

#### Features

- Structured graph query DSL, plus unit hierarchy grouping and traversal in queries
- Multi-source artifact indexes restored to production grade
- Managed embeddings published progressively, so partial indexes stay queryable during enrichment retries
- Authoritative cross-runtime index readiness, recoverable index generation repair, and a clearer `index wait`
- Catalog routing as a first-class capability
- Algebraic indexes gain dynamic projections and adaptive HyperLogLog cardinality
- `$min` document transforms
- Object storage checksum provenance; embedding activity and backup bundle architecture exposed
- Lake-native Parquet and Iceberg serving foundations, and a yacc-generated SQL parser foundation
- Configurable query, write, and inference admission; adaptive vector cache governance; unified inference resource ownership with enforced process envelopes
- Gemma 4 26B-A4B on Metal and CUDA; faster Gemma 4 E2B/E4B Metal decode with long-context correctness fixes @timkaye11
- Metal support for ModernBERT, NomicBERT, BGE-M3, Florence-2, and GLiNER2 and DeBERTa rerankers; quantized Mixedbread ONNX rerankers @timkaye11
- Inference execution is cancellable and observable, with HTTP cancellation and worker recovery tested end to end
- Operator: custom Kubernetes cluster domains, stable data pod routes, and unsafe metadata replica changes rejected
- Standard Linux containers built with glibc; CLI packages published from hosted runners; Python 3.11 through 3.14 supported

#### Bug Fixes

- Raft: retry-safe data apply replay, progress rounds and exact metadata proposal receipts, isolated read-index heartbeat contexts, bounded replication pipelines, and preserved metadata cadence
- Restore: fenced restore attempts recover, CLI restore polling tolerates transient responses, generated indexes survive native backups, and backup create admission is enforced
- Metadata: exact proposal application, mutation leader discovery, control-round authority churn, and fenced snapshot reads
- Index lifecycle: false DDL failures after status fencing, deferred lifecycle retries, stale incarnation status handoff, and repair handoff through fenced status publication
- Enrichment retry wedges across runtime boundaries; artifact-backed embedding indexes executable; artifact indexes preserved during embedding publication; materialized chunk embedding writes after list growth @dovinmu
- Artifact full-text merge scaling past 1M chunks
- Auth: request authorization boundaries hardened, durable destination authority bound, internal RPC authenticated across upgrades, transaction leaders rediscovered securely, direct browser query access secured
- HTTP: 413 returned before admitting oversized HTTP/1 bodies
- Inference: Bedrock request construction, preload registry variants, POSIX file advice gated to Linux, weight lifetimes bounded and Metal request contexts reclaimed, embedding CLI results written to stdout, standalone workers isolated
- PDF: compressed remote content decoded before extraction @dovinmu, stencil colors and sparse pattern transparency honored, remaining pdf-hard corpus gaps closed
- Autosplit: lost forced scans, and incomplete split provisioning snapshots retried
- Quickstart: index readiness, search, chunking, and retry contracts; Gemma multimodal inference and streaming completion
- Antfarm: table creation defaults and errors, artifact query retrieval
- Chunk overlap bounded and generation capacity errors preserved
- HBC recall under cache governance; overlapping vector cache fills bounded

#### Performance

- Exact graph pattern queries optimized
- Persistent ordered memory snapshots; public vector ingest memory and compaction optimized; HBC vector cache reads sharded
- Linear merge uses ordered hash scans; catalog routing no longer takes the Raft runtime lock
- Bounded runtime graph and parallel memory scheduling ported to the Zig runtime

#### Removed

- The end-of-life Go server implementations. The Go SDK, operator, docsaf, evalaf, genkit plugin, and memoryaf remain

#### Packaging

- Go, Python, and TypeScript SDKs v0.2.0 released to coincide with the v0.2.x series
- Operator v0.1.0 supports the full v0.2.x feature set and CLI interface
- Antfly installs with pip, npm, or Homebrew, and inference on macOS is much friendlier

Thanks to @markhayden, James, and Drew for finding and helping tackle things that were dropped from the Go port or were plain bugs in the new code, and to batz.prime for finding restore bugs on Raft deployments and the testing gaps behind them.

### [0.2.0] - 2026-08-10

Antfly v0.2.0 is a ground-up rewrite of the engine in Zig with zero dependencies outside the repository. It is the default release from this version on, uses less memory and CPU than the Go engine with a smaller RSS footprint, and adds a great deal of surface area that the Go engine never had.

#### Highlights

- **Zig runtime** — lower memory and CPU usage, a smaller RSS footprint, zero third-party dependencies, and WASM compatibility
- **Storage backends for every workload** — single-file (Antfly Lite, `.aflite`, SQLite-shaped), standalone LSM, distributed multi-Raft, and serverless over object storage, with portable AFB backups to move data between them
- **Inference in the database** — run GGUF, ONNX, and safetensors models, or fine-tune them, directly in Antfly, across many LLM and small-model architectures with Metal and CUDA acceleration
- **Artifacts API** — declarative JSON pipelines that run OCR, graph relation extraction, embeddings, LLM enrichment, and classification inside the database, the work you would otherwise build as a downstream queue or data engineering pipeline
- **Query language** — a simpler Bleve-style DSL that covers roughly 99% of Elasticsearch query capabilities, plus an improved foreign table planner
- **Index management** — Postgres-style visibility and control over indexes: rebuilds, cursors, and health status
- **Wider content types** — native PDF to PNG rendering for embedding generation, more audio formats, and hardened remote content handling
- **Testing** — deterministic simulation (VOPR-style) and TLA+ trace validation across Raft, transactions, snapshots, and shard splits

#### Upgrade compatibility

Antfly 0.2.0 is not an in-place data-directory upgrade from 0.1.x. Durable
formats changed without a 0.1.x compatibility path. Replace or wipe 0.1.x pods
and create fresh 0.2.0 data directories; export and restore any data that must
be retained.

The Python SDK now exposes transform operators with stable semantic enum names
(`SET`, `SET_ON_INSERT`, `UNSET`, `INC`, `ADD_TO_SET`, and `MAX`). Positional
`VALUE_n` names are not part of the 0.2 API.

Dense-query `_score` values now follow the same relevance convention as text,
sparse, hybrid, and Elasticsearch-style search results: higher values rank
first. Code that previously treated dense `_score` as a lower-is-better vector
distance must use the new optional `_distance` field instead. `_distance`
retains the raw metric-specific distance for direct dense hits. On a source
group ranked by dense descendants it is the distance of the best descendant
that supplied the group score. It is omitted for non-dense and fused results.

- PDF: malformed content recovery, extraction failure recovery, bounded extraction memory, unsupported OCR backend paths @stinkbugaf
- Corrupt indexes dropped without blocking shard startup; full-text enrichment index provisioning; artifact-backed chunk embeddings
- Remote content credential resolution and security config; store backup path handling @dovinmu; SearchAF Zig runtime response contracts
