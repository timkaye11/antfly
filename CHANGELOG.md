## Releases

### [0.2.0] - Unreleased

#### Upgrade compatibility

Antfly 0.2.0 is not an in-place data-directory upgrade from 0.1.x. Durable
formats changed without a 0.1.x compatibility path. Replace or wipe 0.1.x pods
and create fresh 0.2.0 data directories; export and restore any data that must
be retained.

### [0.1.1] - 2026-03-31

#### Highlights

- **Faster Standalone Mode** — local shard bypass eliminates network hops and JSON serialization for single-node deployments, significantly reducing query latency
- **Smarter Vector Search** — automatic reranking and size-aware search effort tuning deliver better recall out of the box
- **Friendlier Errors** — LLM generation failures now return clear, actionable error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Automatic Shard Management** — Antfly now automatically splits large shards and merges underutilized ones, keeping cluster performance balanced without manual intervention
- **memoryaf** — a new MCP-compatible memory service with built-in HTTP API and dashboard for memory-augmented search

#### Features

- Automatic shard split policy keeps individual shards from growing too large
- Online shard merges consolidate underutilized shards without downtime
- Local shard bypass skips HTTP and serialization overhead in standalone mode
- Single-shard fast path and index caching speed up common query patterns
- Automatic reranking for HBC vector search improves recall without configuration
- Size-aware search effort defaults adapt to index size automatically
- Hybrid full-text fallback when embedding indexes are unavailable
- Packed dense and sparse embedding format accepted in the query API
- Unified bounded agent APIs across all generated clients
- memoryaf: MCP-compatible memory service with HTTP API and embedded dashboard
- Richer query builder schema context for better autocomplete
- NER entity extraction and knowledge graph support in docsaf
- LLM generation error classification with user-friendly messages @dovinmu

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix cosine distance centroid normalization in HBC indexes @dovinmu
- Fix RaBit centroid clone aliasing causing quantization regressions @dovinmu
- Fix nil-interface panic in enricher stats during health checks — thanks @montanaflynn!
- Fix raft serveChannels shutdown hang — thanks @montanaflynn!
- Fix shard orphaning in StopRaftGroup when shard is initializing @esniff

- Fix split write routing during handoff, cutover, and readiness transitions
- Fix Store.Close goroutine leak after shard shutdown
