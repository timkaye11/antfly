# Laya typed decisions

Laya models answer classification questions without generating text. Antfly serves
prepared Laya checkpoints through `/ai/v1/extract` with `schema_version: 2` and
extraction provider `antfly`. They appear under extractors in model discovery.

Prepare a checkpoint from a local upstream download, or from a pinned Hugging
Face revision:

```sh
uv run scripts/laya/prepare_laya.py convaiinnovations/laya \
  --revision <full-hugging-face-commit-sha> \
  --output ./models/extractors/laya
antfly standalone --models-dir ./models
```

The importer combines the encoder and decision configuration, preserves the
weights and calibration, and copies the tokenizer. It refuses to overwrite an
existing directory. Native support requires a ModernBERT-backed checkpoint with
the Laya decision heads. The runtime validates tensor shapes before execution.
Unprepared upstream checkpoints are not automatically converted by `inference pull`.

CUDA execution is available for Laya checkpoints with sequence lengths up to 512
and encoder head dimensions up to 128. It uses FP32 resident weights and bounded
internal batches. The English checkpoint was validated on NVIDIA L4 using fatbin
artifacts. Portable PTX requires a driver compatible with the CUDA toolkit used
to generate it.

Submit a text request to the server's AI endpoint:

```json
{
  "model": "laya",
  "schema_version": 2,
  "inputs": [{"id": "request-1", "content": "Find the document about refunds."}],
  "schema": {
    "classifications": [
      {
        "name": "tool",
        "mode": "single",
        "instruction": "Which tool should handle the request?",
        "labels": ["search", "fetch_document", "no_tool"],
        "label_definitions": {
          "search": {"description": "Find documents matching a topic"},
          "fetch_document": {"description": "Retrieve a document with a known ID"},
          "no_tool": {"description": "Respond without a tool"}
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "urgency",
        "mode": "ordinal",
        "instruction": "How urgent is this request?",
        "labels": ["routine", "soon", "immediate"]
      },
      {
        "name": "tool_needed",
        "mode": "boolean",
        "instruction": "Does answering require retrieving external information?",
        "labels": ["false", "true"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`single` maps to Laya `choice`, `ordinal` to `score`, and `boolean` to `noul`.
Boolean labels must be exactly `false`, then `true`. Each task requires a name,
an instruction (`prompt` is an alias), and 2–20 distinct labels. Ordinal labels
are ordered from lowest to highest; descriptions, when present, supply rubric
text. Per-input `schema` and `options` replace the corresponding shared values.

Each output contains compatible `classifications` entries with the selected
label and its probability, plus `decisions` with:

- The full probability distribution in request label order.
- `expected_value` for ordinal tasks, on the zero-based level scale.
- `true_probability` for boolean tasks.
- `confidence` and `confidence_method`. Choice and ordinal confidence measures
  normalized inverse entropy; boolean confidence is the larger class probability.
- `act_probability`, the auxiliary action-head output, for models that have
  one (Laya checkpoints; not OpenDecider-nano).

The action probability does not execute a tool. An agent can consume these
results to select a tool or a bounded argument; application state, another
extractor, or a generator supplies free-form arguments. The application validates
and executes the resulting call.

The current Laya executor accepts text-only classification schemas. It rejects
multi-label tasks, entities, relations, structures, examples, constraints,
windowing, and unsupported options. `top_k`, when supplied, must be 1. Full
probabilities are always available in `decisions`. Entire batches are validated
and tokenized before inference. Inputs that exceed the checkpoint token budget,
including question and option tokens, are rejected instead of silently truncated.
Up to 128 inputs, 64 tasks per input, and 512 total tasks are accepted, subject
to the server's memory and executor limits.

Checkpoint selection is explicit. Benchmark application-specific accuracy and
calibration before choosing thresholds; model confidence does not establish that
a tool choice is correct. This integration does not change the GLiNER v2 executor.

## OpenDecider-nano

[OpenDecider-nano](https://huggingface.co/manjunathshiva/opendecider-nano)
(Apache 2.0) is a 400M decision model on an Ettin encoder, a ModernBERT
architecture, with Laya's per-option `[MASK]` scoring. Antfly serves it
through the same pipeline and endpoints:

```sh
uv run scripts/laya/prepare_opendecider.py manjunathshiva/opendecider-nano \
  --revision <full-hugging-face-commit-sha> \
  --output ./models/extractors/opendecider-nano
```

The importer merges the encoder and the separate head into one checkpoint and
sets `laya.format: "opendecider"`. That format uses OpenDecider's prompt
(`question:` and `input:` prefixes, its option text, "yes" before "no", no
per-option token cap) and its marker head. It has no type embedding, head
layers or action head, so decisions omit `act_probability`. It runs unpacked,
with a 2,048-token budget; longer inputs are rejected, as for Laya.

## Typed-decisions benchmark

The community benchmark for typed-decision models is the
`LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions` test split (400 cases, 2,000 decisions), scored
per decision against the case's gold label. `scripts/laya/prepare_laya_training_data.sh`
writes it as native records (`td/eval.jsonl`) and cases (`td/eval-cases.jsonl`).

```sh
antfly inference finetune eval laya ./models/extractors/opendecider-nano td/eval.jsonl \
  --backend metal --truncate-state --predictions nano.jsonl
uv run scripts/laya/typed_decisions_bench.py report nano.jsonl other.jsonl \
  --gold td/eval-cases.jsonl
```

`--truncate-state` cuts states that do not fit the checkpoint, as upstream
Laya and OpenDecider do; 160 of the 2,000 decisions exceed Laya's 512 tokens.
Serving never truncates. `report` prints accuracy per question type, Brier
score, ECE and a paired bootstrap interval against the first file.
`typed_decisions_bench.py reference` runs OpenDecider-nano's own PyTorch code
for comparison. On Metal, Antfly matches it to 3e-6 in probability and
reproduces its published 0.796.

## Reference validation

The deterministic fixture exercises the complete encoder, decision heads,
preprocessing, mixed question batches, calibration, HTTP, and embedded extraction.
It uses upstream source with small randomly initialized weights:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/6a5819129eb220570792e417e49723d697efd76f/laya/common.py -o /tmp/laya-common.py
uv run scripts/laya/laya_reference.py --common /tmp/laya-common.py --output /tmp/laya-reference
cd zig
ANTFLY_LAYA_REFERENCE=/tmp/laya-reference python3 tools/run_bounded_zig_build.py \
  build inference-test -Dmetal=false -Dcuda=false -Donnx=false -- --test-filter 'laya '
```

Parity tests skip when `ANTFLY_LAYA_REFERENCE` is unset. Set `ANTFLY_LAYA_METAL=1`
and build with `-Dmetal=true` to require Metal, including the managed extraction
route. A missing GPU fails the test rather than silently selecting CPU.

The synthetic fixture tests independent and reordered batches through the
512-question pipeline limit. Released-checkpoint qualification additionally
compares token IDs and probabilities against upstream PyTorch on labeled data,
checks accuracy, and measures warm batches through 128 rows. See
[qualification results and reproduction](../design/laya-qualification.md).

These checks cover native CPU and Metal. CUDA has a separate
[qualification script](../../scripts/laya_cuda_qualify.py) and
[matched PyTorch performance gate](../../scripts/laya_cuda_performance.py), run
by the [L4 CI workflow](../../.github/workflows/zig-inference-l4-spot.yml).

## Resident Metal inference

Set `ANTFLY_LAYA_METAL_RESIDENT=1` in the serving process environment before
loading the model to enable the resident path. It remains opt-in; the existing
inference path is the default. `TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_LAYA_RESIDENT=1` overrides
the enable flag. Restart the process after changing these settings so loaded
models use a consistent execution path.

Projection weights retain their checkpoint F16/BF16/F32 precision on Metal.
Embedding and normalization constants expand losslessly to F32 once. Encoder
activations, both heads, calibration, and numeric decision decoding stay on the
GPU; each request uploads its inputs and reads back only the final numeric
results. Tokenization, validation, label mapping, and JSON formatting run on CPU.
This applies to inference, including exported finetuned checkpoints; training
still uses the host gradient staging described below.

Size model and request memory budgets for the checkpoint precision and padded
batch geometry. The local full-model API checks used 6 GiB host, 12 GiB backend,
18 GiB combined, and 8 GiB scratch capacity for expanded batches; these are test
settings, not minimum requirements for every workload. Default budgets can
reject FP32 preparation or large requests. Once resident Metal loading is
attempted, admission or execution failures are returned rather than retried on
CPU.

### Measured inference performance

Local qualification on an Apple M4 Pro with 24 GiB memory compared the same
binary with residency disabled and enabled. All 66 paired comparisons passed,
covering 132 paging-free windows and 10,500 timed observations.

| Metric | Released FP16: legacy → resident | Finetuned FP32: legacy → resident |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Batch 1, fixed-input p50 | 65.91 → 25.05 ms | 343.65 → 135.48 ms |
| Batch 1, mixed-input p50 | 178.03 → 99.90 ms | 544.69 → 293.79 ms |
| Batch 1, mixed-input p95 | 237.67 → 144.94 ms | 662.29 → 386.03 ms |
| Interactive geometric-mean p50 reduction | 38.1% | 38.2% |
| Batch 16 / 64 / 128 throughput increase | +26.5% / +8.4% / +6.8% | +26.8% / +7.3% / +4.3% |
| Maximum process footprint, including preparation | 5.08 → 5.59 GB | 7.36 → 6.22 GB |

Each profile used three alternating pairs and ten warmups. Interactive batches
1/2/4/8 used 100 observations per window; bulk batches used 25. Fixed inputs had
61 tokens and four options; mixed inputs included sequences through 512 tokens.
Timings include tokenization and decision decoding, but exclude transport and
JSON serialization. Footprints use decimal GB and include more than model weights.
Paging-contaminated attempts were excluded. The final four windows followed a
filesystem-cache reset, with at least 8 GiB free memory and a 30-second paging-free
idle interval before each window; no reset occurred inside a measurement window.

Warm resident requests showed no repeated weight uploads, intermediate activation
readbacks, or CPU fallbacks, and one final numeric readback. These are API transfer
counters, not physical bus-traffic measurements. Released FP16 probability error
versus PyTorch was at most 2.03e-6 against a 5e-5 tolerance. Tests also cover
finetuned FP32 exports, tiny BF16 fixtures, cancellation, allocation failure,
repeated unloads, and embedded/HTTP requests. Performance results apply to the
tested artifacts, hardware, and profiles.

To reproduce the comparison, generate a reference with
`scripts/laya/laya_export_reference.py`, then build `inference-test` with
`-Dmetal=true -Dcuda=false -Donnx=false -Doptimize=fast` and the `laya `
test filter. Run each checkpoint precision separately:

```sh
python3 scripts/laya/benchmark_laya_metal.py --binary <test-binary> \
  --reference <reference-directory> --output <new-interactive-directory> \
  --batches 1 2 4 8 --profiles fixed mixed
python3 scripts/laya/benchmark_laya_metal.py --binary <test-binary> \
  --reference <reference-directory> --output <new-throughput-directory> \
  --batches 16 64 128 --profiles fixed
```

The runner retains samples, hashes, logs, and paging counters. The throughput-only
invocation exits nonzero because it lacks interactive coverage; assess its
`measurement_runs_valid` and `profile_regression_gates_passed` fields together
with the interactive invocation's `passed` result.

### Default Metal path on the typed-decisions benchmark

The default path (without `ANTFLY_LAYA_METAL_RESIDENT`) scores the full
typed-decisions test split (2,000 decisions, 578,470 tokens) on an Apple M4
Max as follows. Each run was warm, 64 tasks per pipeline call
(`finetune eval laya --chunk`).

| Model | Before | Now | PyTorch on the same machine |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| OpenDecider-nano | 184 s | 54.6 s | 55.9 s (length-sorted batches of 64); 64.4 s (batches of 16) |
| OpenDecider-nano, one decision per call | 149 s | 57.9 s | 70.5 s (batch 1) |
| Laya-large, step-0 fine-tune | 337 s | 85.1 s | |

Probabilities match OpenDecider's PyTorch implementation to 1.3e-6, and the
Laya checkpoint's earlier predictions to 1.7e-6. The ModernBERT encoder on
Metal:
- runs only the real tokens of a batch, with each row its own attention
  segment, instead of padding every row to the longest;
- runs global and sliding-window attention with a tiled kernel that skips
  keys outside a row or its window
  (`TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_TILED_SEGMENT_ATTENTION=1` restores the scalar
  kernel, `ANTFLY_MODERNBERT_SEGMENT_ATTENTION=0` the dense path);
- runs its linears through MPS in F32, expanding BF16 weights
  (`TERMITE_METAL_DISABLE_MODERNBERT_F32_MPS=1` keeps the BF16 kernels, at
  half the weight memory);
- keeps its LayerNorm weights in fixed slots across requests.

Laya also scores markers on the device, and groups inputs of similar length
into the same call on every backend (`ANTFLY_LAYA_BUCKETING=0` disables it).

## Native finetuning

`antfly inference finetune train laya <job.json>` trains the ModernBERT encoder,
question-type embeddings, transformer head, and marker scorer in FP32. Choose
`cpu` or `metal` explicitly. The default `rlcd` objective follows the upstream
[typed-decisions notebook](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/blob/main/notebooks/laya_finetune_typed_decisions_2xT4_kaggle.ipynb):
soft-target cross-entropy plus a centered Gaussian policy-gradient estimator
with log, spherical, and ordinal ranked-probability rewards. `soft_ce` selects
cross-entropy alone. This is full finetuning; it does not produce a LoRA adapter.

Prepare the base checkpoint with `scripts/laya/prepare_laya.py` as above. Supply
separate train and evaluation JSONL files, with one decision per line:

```json
{"id":"case-1/tool","group_id":"case-1","text":"Find the refund policy.","kind":"choice","instruction":"Which tool should handle the request?","labels":["search","fetch_document","no_tool"],"descriptions":["Find documents by topic","Retrieve a known document ID","Answer without a tool"],"target":[0.95,0.03,0.02]}
```

`kind` is `choice`, `score`, or `noul`. Targets are probabilities in label order
and must sum to one; one-hot labels are also valid. Ordinal labels run from
lowest to highest. Boolean labels must be `false`, then `true`. Descriptions
are optional. Preprocessing shares the inference tokenizer and formatting,
including explicit rejection of overlength text. No training examples are
silently truncated or discarded.

To convert a JSONL export of `LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions`, including its
JSON-encoded `state`, `questions`, and `gold` columns:

```sh
python3 scripts/laya/prepare_laya_finetune.py typed-decisions-train.jsonl --output train.jsonl
python3 scripts/laya/prepare_laya_finetune.py typed-decisions-eval.jsonl --output eval.jsonl
```

Keep every question from a source case in the same split. The trainer rejects
cross-split ID, group, source-text, and token-sequence overlap. Unlike the
notebook, calibration uses a separate optional `calibration_file`; it never
fits on the training or evaluation examples.

Example `job.json` (all paths must be absolute):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "model_dir": "/models/extractors/laya",
  "train_file": "/data/laya/train.jsonl",
  "eval_file": "/data/laya/eval.jsonl",
  "output_dir": "/runs/laya-domain-v1",
  "backend": "metal",
  "objective": "rlcd",
  "epochs": 4,
  "batch_size": 1,
  "gradient_accumulation": 4,
  "encoder_lr": 0.000025,
  "head_lr": 0.0001,
  "head_dropout": 0.1,
  "seed": 42
}
```

The output directory must be new. The run writes `metrics.jsonl`, resumable
`latest.safetensors`, and a final `report.json` containing data/run hashes,
initial/final evaluation metrics, and optimizer progress. A completed run
publishes `model/`, which can be loaded as an ordinary Laya extractor. The
report's `complete` status means training and export completed; assess its
held-out results before deploying the checkpoint.

To resume, keep the original job settings, set `resume_from` to the previous
`latest.safetensors`, and choose a new output directory. Checkpoints bind the
source weights, tokenizer, configuration, datasets, and training settings.
They preserve AdamW moments and partial gradient accumulation. The optional
`stop_after_microbatches` setting saves a resumable checkpoint at a safe boundary
without exporting a serving model. Checkpoints are otherwise saved every
`checkpoint_every_steps` microbatches (default 100) and at epoch boundaries.

The action head remains frozen because these targets do not supervise it.
Changing the encoder can still change action probabilities, so validate those
separately. Old calibration buckets are removed on export. Without a calibration
split, temperatures reset to one. With one, a bounded per-type temperature
search fits only types having at least ten calibration examples.

This training path uses materialized attention and a bounded host
allocator (`max_host_bytes`, default 24 GiB). Metal gradients pass through
explicit host staging before resident AdamW updates; this is not a fully
device-resident training graph. CPU matrix products use system BLAS with FP64
accumulation when available, retaining the portable fallback. Start with small
batches. It does not implement CUDA/DDP, mixed precision, encoder dropout, or activation
recomputation. The small-model parity and lifecycle tests below are distinct
from application-specific accuracy or throughput qualification.

### Training parity and lifecycle checks

```sh
python3 scripts/laya/laya_training_reference.py --common /tmp/laya-common.py --fixture /tmp/laya-reference
cd zig
ANTFLY_LAYA_REFERENCE=/tmp/laya-reference python3 tools/run_bounded_zig_build.py \
  --zig /path/to/zig-0.16.0 build inference-test -Dmetal=false -Dcuda=false -Donnx=false \
  -- --test-filter 'laya training'
```

Create `/tmp/laya-reference` with the forward reference command above first.
Set `ANTFLY_LAYA_METAL=1` and `-Dmetal=true` for the GPU checks; unavailable
Metal fails explicitly. The fixture checks forward logits, the notebook loss,
every parameter gradient, partial-accumulation resume equivalence, and reopening
the exported artifact through the serving loader.

Training snapshots source weights and tokenizer assets during admission, so
later source-file changes cannot alter the serving export. Optional
`tokenizer_config.json` and `special_tokens_map.json` are preserved when present.
Admission checks the largest padded batch across every split; an oversized
later example fails before a run directory is created. Resume validates both
the optimizer cursor and partial accumulation state. `stop_after_microbatches`
is an absolute position and must be ahead of a resumed checkpoint and within
the configured epochs.

### Measured training quality and scope

Full-checkpoint qualification covers CPU soft CE with system BLAS and Metal
soft CE/RLCD on Apple M4 Pro with 24 GiB memory, using batch one, accumulation
four, seed 42, and sequences capped at 512 tokens. The source checkpoint is
`convaiinnovations/laya` revision `c5d78730f3493e4fe16d61507ef4b78eef7318cf`.
The synthetic `LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions` dataset is pinned to revision
`ea9306458d6e9563628369a3d1e72e362fb381d2`, with 32 training cases / 160 decisions,
32 held-out cases / 160 decisions, and 16 calibration cases / 80 decisions.
Each split covers four workflows and all three question types.

After two epochs, 320 microbatches, and 80 optimizer updates:

| Metric | Released source | CPU soft CE | Metal soft CE | Metal RLCD |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Serving-calibrated soft CE | 1.302114 | 1.049589 | 1.046249 | 1.091510 |
| Argmax accuracy | 43.75% | 50.625% | 50.625% | 51.25% |

All three training profiles pass their held-out quality gates. Soft CE uses
dropout zero and a matched PyTorch training replay; RLCD uses head dropout 0.1
and is compared against the source baseline, without claiming a full stochastic
training replay. Paired-case accuracy intervals include zero improvement, so
the observed accuracy increases do not establish application-level gains.

All 201 trainable gradient tensors pass on CPU and Metal for source and trained
checkpoints at the unchanged tolerance `5e-5 + 0.002 * max(abs(reference_tensor))`.
The oracle uses FP64 encoder/head arithmetic with upstream FP32 logits/loss;
FP32-only reference discrepancies at near-zero ReLU inputs are not covered by
that parity claim. Full-size interrupted RLCD resume produces byte-identical
optimizer state and serving exports. Exported checkpoints pass CPU/Metal serving
reloads against PyTorch within the 5e-5 probability tolerance.

The measured CPU soft-CE job used a 24 GiB host bound; Metal jobs used 16 GiB.
Training runs observed paging. These bounds exclude some driver allocations and
do not guarantee physical-memory residency or zero-swap operation. Sustained
CPU RLCD, other hardware/recipes, and application traffic require separate
qualification. In particular, inference residency does not make the training
graph fully GPU-resident.
