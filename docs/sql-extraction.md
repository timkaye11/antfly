# SQL extraction implementation ledger

SQL extraction starts at main `227f2dc39` after catalog #691 and relational #784.
The behavioral reference is `combine-pr-141-143-144` at `79644dfa1`.
This ledger is not a claim that all SQL surfaces are available.

**Status: SQL extraction is in progress, not ready as a complete SQL feature.**

Full native PostgreSQL regex parity is a required remaining workstream, not
satisfied by the replacement engine's current component witnesses. Its target
profiles, implementation boundaries and release gates are tracked in
[the regex parity design](design/sql-regex-parity.md).
The implementation now includes scalar and aggregate execution, joins and CTEs,
native catalog DDL, durable READ COMMITTED sessions/savepoints, and public SQL
interfaces. It does not yet reproduce the mega branch's complete SQL behavior.

SQL expression DDL now lowers immutable scalar defaults and STORED generated
columns into the shared durable expression VM. Binding sees the complete
candidate schema, including forward base columns, but SQL rejects generated
self/cross references and request-bound parameters. Checked numeric assignment
casts retain write-time overflow and atomic batch rollback. Populated ADD uses
the metadata-owned staged rewrite rather than publishing nullable generated
columns without backfill; rewrite preparation projects only expression inputs.
Failed candidate edits leave the original schema untouched. Tests cover
allocation faults, LSM reopen and portable restore, alongside a PostgreSQL
oracle. This is component activation, not original-case completion credit.
Exact-decimal arithmetic, volatile defaults/sequence authority, virtual columns
and array DDL remain explicit gaps.

### Current capability reconciliation (2026-10-06)

Reviewed against main `09b78df97`, after lake integration, Loadscape fixes,
embedded execution separation and the Zig 0.17 migration. The chronological
notes below describe checkpoints; they are not an additive list of missing
features. The earlier single-namespace, CTE-source and FK/graph-TRUNCATE limits
have been superseded for the supported providers.

| Surface | Available shape | Actual remaining boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reads and operators | Joins, sets, CTEs, aggregates/windows, typed batch kernels, spill-backed blocking operators and pgwire continuation pages | Exact original-case adjudication; broader correlated/lateral shapes; remote workloads rather than only local kernel benchmarks |
| Mutations | Native/document DML, joined UPDATE/DELETE, read-only CTE sources, MERGE, normalized RETURNING and guarded UNIQUE conflict ownership | Data-modifying CTE dataflow; broader demand-masked/correlated conflict subqueries and index membership proofs; MERGE partial/expression-key probe planning |
| Recursion | Bounded linear delta worklists, typed deduplication and captured physical sources | Mutual/nonlinear recursion, recursive aggregates/windows and nullable-side recursive self joins reject explicitly |
| Sessions and protocols | READ COMMITTED sessions/savepoints, durable HTTP prepared/connection resources, pgwire scroll/hold cursors, typed settings and ordered multi-namespace lookup | Stronger-isolation provider activation/fault coverage, TTL visibility contract, guarded Lite sessions, restart/failover ownership and complete setting/policy parity; HTTP has no connection-owned cursor resource |
| Catalog and retirement | Native schema/index/constraint DDL; hosted and native standalone external-FK/graph TRUNCATE with durable publication/recovery receipts | Owned sequences/serial declarations, broader schema rewrite/restore and standby-promotion gates; pending receipts are not synchronous publication |
| Row policies | Versioned settings/policy catalog, owner proofs and guarded publication, including native/standby component coverage | Every public protected route, revocation/restore and promoted-primary fault/security validation; unsupported providers remain closed |
| Lake SQL | Read-only Parquet/Iceberg attachments, snapshot/version pinning, pruning, bounded typed cursors, shared caches and spill | Remote end-to-end performance/recovery evidence; writes, nested/binary inference and native SQL decimal semantics are not claimed |

This branch has 1,169 blocking dispositions, down from 1,381 on the main base.
Of these, **130 are original rejection contracts**, not missing positive
functionality; 1,039 require behavior review. Four have recorded partial
evidence and 1,165 have no case-linked evidence. Absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence of an implementation. The 212 newly closed cases have
exact-source executable evidence, not parser-success or component-overlap credit.

The work queue, grouped without double-counting original IDs, is:

| Queue | Blocking cases | Next acceptance criterion |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Original rejection contracts | 130 | Execute exact SQL/parameters and check deliberate diagnostic/nonadmission behavior; newly supported behavior needs tested supersession |
| Reads, queries, aggregates, windows and joins | 316 | Mounted result/null/type/authorization assertions, plus bounded-work and cancellation cases for the admitted shape |
| Positive DDL and session contracts | 349 | Separate public protocol behavior from obsolete planner fingerprints; verify durable publication, pending receipts and owner recovery where required |
| Mutation and population contracts | 337 | Exact affected rows/RETURNING, one guarded commit, conflict/no-write failure behavior and physical read-back; cross-owner faults where required |
| Lateral, query functions and EXPLAIN | 37 | Distinguish executable shapes from explicit unsupported shapes and fabricated planner/cost contracts |

Start with exact-case evidence on already admitted shapes; implement only gaps
exposed by that comparison. Keep deployment activation gates distinct:
distributed isolation/RLS integrity, owned sequence semantics and
shared artifact-stream certification each need their own fault matrices.
Broader graph/enrichment/resolver provenance, producer completion, adoption,
recovery and all-member capability barriers are shared storage work, not
additional SQL grammar features. The final ordered-artifact checklist below
remains open independently of source-corpus parity.

Use `python3 scripts/check_sql_parity_inventory.py --report` for current
family counts; `--family read --report` limits reporting only. Use
`--evidence --family read` or `--evidence` with repeated `--gate NAME` to run recorded
evidence without claiming release readiness. Families without recorded gates,
unknown gates and gates outside the selected family fail rather than reporting
an empty successful run. Gate selection is not allowed with `--release`, and
`--release --family read` still validates the entire inventory.
Zig 0.17 evidence commands use repeatable `-Dtest-filter=...` options so native
test owners receive compile-time selection, rather than relying on ignored
runtime arguments. Shared gate filters are grouped into one build per owner.
Native standalone TRUNCATE has a linked restart regression in
`standalone/runtime.zig` (`standalone native TRUNCATE external FK and graph
publish after restart`); this inspection does not claim that its linked suite
was rerun in the reconciliation batch.

Initial reconciliation validation on the main base: all 20 audit unit tests pass,
inventory integrity passes with unchanged dispositions, and nine selected
evidence gates pass. The narrowed SQL compiler/prepared-CTE/EXPLAIN run passes
seven server-owner tests plus six local-owner tests; the pgwire selection covers
ordered search paths, prepared reads, cursor forms and session commands. Two
mounted public-handler tests pass exact relational reads and coordinated UNIQUE
default-conflict updates. Initial broad pgwire execution needed permission to
bind local sockets; the final narrowed gates pass without the unrelated listener
tests. This is representative evidence, not an execution of all 1,586 cases or
the linked native TRUNCATE/promoted-standby suites. No case received release
credit merely because an overlapping component test passed.

### Exact-source adjudication batch

The shared `Corpus` loader owns all 1,586 original statements and parameters,
validates ordinal identities and provides O(1) lookup. Seventy-seven original
rejection contracts now assert their precise compiler error and diagnostic
range before backend access. The other original rejection contracts compile
today and still need runtime rejection evidence or a tested supersession.

The native public HTTP fixture executes 115 additional exact reads with
independent, bounded SQLite expectations: full rows, duplicate multiplicity,
explicit column labels, exact integers and SQL NULL provenance. The original
tagged internal parameters are decoded into today's public JSON values without
changing their logical types. Discovery never changes dispositions; only
reviewed cases with a passing mounted gate receive evidence. The reference
cannot mutate its database and has instruction/result limits. SQLite-only
semantics, unsupported syntax and vacuous fixtures are excluded without credit.
In particular, default NULL ordering and division-by-zero semantics cannot be
adjudicated from SQLite. Two additional exact native contracts verify descending
NULL ordering and implicit window labels without imposing unspecified peer
order. The explicit empty WHERE-false contract is the sole empty-result exemption.

That comparison exposed missing `trunc`/`sign` functions and compound window
ORDER BY aliases. The functions use the shared typed scalar pipeline, retaining
exact integer values and checking type, arity and nonfinite inputs. Window
orders now expand aliases once in the output domain, preserve window-input
scope, resolve implicit function labels, reject ambiguous aliases and reuse
computed window slots. Mixed and qualified wildcards expand through the pinned
visible source layout before binding, preserving duplicate output labels and
quoted identifiers. Expansion checks the 1,024-column budget before allocating
the output layout, preventing repeated stars from amplifying binding work. A second
regression bounds final sort heap capacity by actual materialized rows rather
than response headroom, including nested queries; oversized results still fail
with their original result-limit error.

Validation: 27 audit/reference unit tests; the full SQL target (131 server-owner
tests and 265 local-owner tests); native
HTTP execution of all 115 selected reference reads and two native contracts;
and reproducible golden expectations. Work-bound coverage admits a
three-row ordered window under a 256 KiB budget with 4,096-row response headroom,
without weakening result limits. These are correctness/resource bounds, not a
claimed wall-clock speedup. DDL/session and mutation/population adjudication,
the other read fixtures and the distributed activation matrices remain open.

Eleven exact UPDATE/DELETE contracts now execute on a separate two-row native
fixture. Each checks the affected-row count, complete RETURNING values and
labels, NULL provenance, persisted postimage or deletion, and the untouched
row. A mixed RETURNING expression that divides by zero must return `22012`
without changing primary bytes, version or content digest. This is single-owner
behavioral coverage, not certification of old point-index plan fingerprints or
distributed fault matrices.

SELECT and RETURNING share projection parsing and bounded wildcard expansion.
Expansion carries transient pinned-layout ordinals, so duplicate derived labels
do not collapse into ambiguous name lookups. INSERT/UPDATE evaluate prepared
postimages and DELETE evaluates its captured preimage; hidden physical metadata
stays out of stars. MERGE's unqualified star is target-only, while qualified
source stars use its authorized captured domain. A catalog-only dependency pass
shares the identity cache with final binding and deduplicates scan dependencies;
ordinary non-wildcard projections do not allocate an expansion array. Tests
cover allocation failure, pre-write output limits, source/target MERGE domains,
duplicate names, and quoted window labels containing literal dots.

Native discovery also confirmed that `sql-1519` remains a real parser/scope gap:
three-part column references such as `public.usage_records.id` are not admitted.
Its disposition remains unresolved; successful ONLY-qualified table references
and ordinary aliases do not waive that separate contract.

### External lake SQL integration

Relational table schemas can attach a read-only Parquet prefix or Iceberg table
with `base_source`. The attachment persists with the native schema and is
resolved through the catalog for public typed-row queries and SQL over HTTP or
pgwire. Table creation can infer `document_schemas` and `schema_fingerprint`
from lake metadata. For example, this table schema needs no column declaration:

```json
{
  "storage_mode": "relational",
  "base_source": {
    "kind": "external",
    "table_id": "events",
    "format": "parquet",
    "uri": "s3://analytics/events",
    "credentials": {"ref": "analytics-lake", "scope": "events"},
    "snapshot": {"mode": "current"},
    "write_policy": "read_only"
  }
}
```

Creation reads Parquet footers or the selected Iceberg schema, without decoding
rows. Parquet inference combines all listed files, marks absent/nullable fields
optional, and rejects incompatible types. Iceberg uses field IDs, types and
requiredness from metadata; a pinned snapshot uses its schema. Empty Iceberg
tables are supported. The discovered columns and fingerprint are persisted
before catalog publication, so SQL Describe and Execute use stable types.

Inference supports flat booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, UTF-8 strings,
timestamps and decimal strings that preserve precision. Decimal values use exact
integer-and-scale decoding up to precision 38, including 16-byte binary values,
and retain trailing fractional zeros. They have SQL string semantics; casts to
floating-point numbers are explicit. Timestamp filters compare exact signed
epoch nanoseconds, accepting timezone offsets and dates before 1970. Nested, binary and
unsupported logical types fail explicitly. Parquet inference needs a schema-bearing
file. Missing optional columns become SQL NULL; incompatible types and missing
required columns fail scans. New fields do not silently expand the catalog.
Explicit schemas/fingerprints remain supported; omitted fingerprints default to
`auto`. Schema discovery also runs through MCP and SQL catalog creation.

Credential references use configured `external_io` connections with `lake_read`
capability and enforce their bucket/prefix scope. Iceberg attachments use
`format: "iceberg"` and the snapshot schema fingerprint (for example,
`iceberg-schema:7`). A snapshot selector can instead pin an Iceberg snapshot ID
or a Parquet object-version digest. Filesystem sources use the existing
filesystem object-store layout under its `antfly` bucket.

Each SQL statement pins source inventories and object versions. Repeated table
aliases share the inventory, and mixed joins retain the native statement read.
SQL applies its existing projections, predicates, aggregates, joins, CTEs, set
operations and windows to lake cursors. Public row queries apply residual
predicates before limits and emit snapshot-derived `_id` values. Iceberg reads
apply the existing position/equality delete machinery. Provider reads receive
the request's cancellation and deadline.

Lake cursors pull typed column batches, retaining one file's footer/delete
metadata and one decoded page per projected column. Opening a pinned cursor does not read data
pages; the first page need not wait for later files. Aggregate execution consumes
selected typed cells directly, and row objects are created at the row API
boundary. Physical snapshot identities use opaque versioned `lake1:` IDs with
numeric row-group/row ordinals. File metadata is ordered by identity before
scanning, so pagination needs no full row sort. IDs are stable within a snapshot;
clients must preserve them verbatim and must not parse or synthesize them.

Simple integer, string and boolean comparisons prune disjoint row groups from
footer min/max statistics, and files can be skipped when their known row groups
are all disjoint. Iceberg partition pruning resolves each file's spec ID and source
field IDs, then conservatively projects identity, bucket, truncate and temporal
predicates. Unknown specs, transforms, values and comparisons remain residual. Missing statistics, annotated decimal/timestamp types and
unsupported comparisons stay residual; predicates and Iceberg position/equality
deletes are evaluated before page limits. Exact unfiltered `COUNT(*)` uses footer
row counts only when no deletes or cursor constraints apply. Other aggregates,
filtered counts and delete-bearing counts scan the selected rows normally.

API SQL reads share a server-owned 64 MiB range cache (at most 4,096 entries).
Keys bind the credential reference/scope, source endpoint, object version and
byte range. Unversioned reads bypass it; cache hits still check cancellation and
deadlines. Shared cached bytes are separate from each statement's memory budget.
The cursor prefetches exact upcoming data-page ranges, next-group header probes
(or the next file's footer) through the existing I/O runtime: at most four
concurrent reads and 32 MiB of requested ranges per lookahead batch. Worker buffers use
independent allocations outside the SQL arena; provider response copies can add
temporary memory. Closing or canceling a cursor cancels and joins every worker
before releasing source metadata. Prefetch failures stay speculative: required
reads still enforce pinned versions, deadlines and cancellation.

Iceberg admissions revalidate the metadata pointer and content, then lease an
immutable snapshot plan from the decoded cache. Each admission owns its mutable
file-version state. Partition and file-bound pruning happen before data-object
HEAD requests; surviving files are pinned once before reading their footers.
Prepared equality/position delete indexes also use cache-owned immutable leases,
keyed by plan/applicability, limits and provider versions. Unversioned objects
bypass index reuse. Request cancellation handles and footer-derived position
offsets remain outside cached membership state.

Each stream admits at most 100,000,000 examined rows. Parquet decoding aligns
independent column pages and decodes each column dictionary once. Up to four
column decoders overlap provider reads and page decoding; allocation admission
is serialized, and every worker joins before releasing cursor state. The 32 MiB
input/decoded budgets apply to the active page set, rather than the entire row group. Large
individual pages and dictionaries can still fail admission. SQL defaults admit
10,000,000 scanned rows, 65,536 scan pages and 256 MiB retained bytes per statement.
The embedded SQL JSON request limit is 64 MiB (67,108,864 bytes), including
statement text and parameters. Preparation and execution each have a 256 MiB
working-memory budget: decoded inputs, mutation staging and storage encodings
can coexist, so this is distinct from the wire limit. Embedded SQL sessions
admit 4,096 staged mutations and 256 MiB of staging memory. Native transaction
intents additionally use the configured admission limit (128 MiB by default). Oversized
requests return SQLSTATE `54000` with the numeric wire limit; execution remains
bounded by memory, result, syntax and work quotas rather than a 2 MiB value cap.
Nested pipelines reduce internal page sizes under smaller budgets.

Blocking sorts, grouped aggregates (including DISTINCT inputs), hash-join build
rows and window partitions spill through a shared statement owner. In-memory
sort heaps grow with admitted rows instead of eagerly allocating their maximum
logical cardinality; growth and row storage share the retained-byte budget.
Sorts merge
bounded runs and stream past OFFSET; the final merge reads up to eight run heads
directly without writing another complete run. Groups merge partial states one
key at a time. Spilled joins sequentially hash-partition both sides, retaining
one build partition at a time and preserving outer-join match markers. A
bounded runtime filter skips certainly absent probe keys when outer semantics
permit it. Oversized partitions recursively split on unused hash bits with bounded depth
and open files; inseparable duplicate keys retain the disk-chain fallback.
Snapshot-local row estimates, bounded derived-query LIMITs, and source byte
estimates choose the smaller build side when comparable estimates exist. Window passes retain partition
rows, peer/group directories and aggregate frame trees on disk, with small
tracked caches. Separate cell records store window outputs without rewriting
the original row payload for each function. Window sorts carry row indices instead
of wide row payloads. Sliding COUNT, integer SUM, BOOL_AND and BOOL_OR use exact
removable state with constant memory; other aggregates and exclusions retain
the frame tree. Ranking, navigation,
ROWS/RANGE/GROUPS and frame exclusions keep their existing semantics. Quantified pattern sets use external DISTINCT and a
reusable statement-owned file; matching retains one pattern at a time.

API SQL statements default to a shared 1 GiB live spill quota and at most 64
open spill files per statement. `sql.runtime.Limits` exposes `spill_bytes`
(`0` disables spilling) and `spill_root` (default `/tmp`). Temporary directories
and files are private; files are immediately unlinked while open, and handles
and directories are cleaned up on completion, cancellation and error. Spill
records preserve exact numeric tags, SQL/JSON null distinction and row order,
with length and checksum validation. Disk exhaustion and oversized records
still return errors. Spill I/O uses bounded read-ahead and double-buffered
asynchronous writes where concurrency is available. Repetitive large records
use the existing Snappy codec when it saves space; decoded lengths and checksums
remain validated before rows are accepted. Small join budgets reduce per-file
buffer sizes to leave room for the active partition.

Pgwire can deliver sorted, grouped and window results in bounded pages, beyond
the materialized response row cap. Execution pins one statement cut and
transfers ownership of the completed sort into the result cursor, avoiding a
second full result spool. Delivered in-memory rows are released immediately;
external sorts merge directly into continuation pages. Other blocking shapes
retain the spool fallback without rescanning source data. Explicit SQL LIMIT/OFFSET, ordering and NULL flags are
preserved. HTTP JSON response limits remain; blocking projections involving
external decision providers retain the existing bounded materialization path.

Numeric and boolean expression batches use bounded instruction-major kernels,
including four-lane exact integer and floating-point arithmetic/comparisons.
String comparisons and boolean unary operations also run by batch. Eligible
streaming filters/projections and aggregate input expressions consume selected
column pages directly, applying predicates before computing projections. Live
intermediate vectors reuse workspace slots; global COUNT, integer SUM and
boolean reductions avoid per-row grouping probes. Mixed numeric values retain
scalar conversion semantics. Lazy expressions (CASE, AND/OR) and
unsupported types/functions use the scalar evaluator.

Repeatable native microbenchmarks run with
`zig build sql-native-refinement-bench lake-native-refinement-bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
from `zig/`. The measured baseline and refined paths validate equivalent outputs
and alternate execution order across three samples at each size. Raw samples,
fixture details and median timings are in
[`native-sql-refinements.json`](../zig/bench/baselines/native-sql-refinements.json).
The sort and partitioned-join cases also report first-row latency, allocator
peaks, backing allocation counts, spill bytes, and physical I/O calls; their
single-sample results are in
[`native-lake-execution-refinements.json`](../zig/bench/baselines/native-lake-execution-refinements.json).
Partitioning can increase writes and first-row latency while reducing random
reads, so those samples are not a general throughput guarantee. Merge-head
arenas retain bounded capacity between records to reduce allocation churn.
These measure CPU kernels and local temporary-file writes; remote lake latency
and end-to-end query throughput need separate measurement. Vector batching
uses more bounded workspace than row-at-a-time scalar evaluation, while reuse
lets long expressions run without retaining one vector per instruction.

The regression fixture scans 131,072 and 1,048,576 integer rows in 65,536-row
Parquet groups under a 32 MiB tracking allocator. Peak tracked allocations are
7,081,703 and 7,081,817 bytes respectively: input growth adds file metadata rather
than retaining all rows. This measures cursor memory for that fixture, not
process memory or query latency. Tests also verify lazy first-page I/O, warm
range reuse, pruning without decoded pages, changed-object rejection, exact
large integers, SQL/JSON null distinction and Iceberg deletes before limits.
Forced-spill SQL tests execute sorting with large OFFSET, grouping with DISTINCT,
and joins under a 256 KiB statement budget. Operator tests cover duplicate join
keys and unmatched rows; spill tests cover quota failures, cancellation, checksum
corruption and cleanup. Prefetch tests prove overlapping reads, warm reuse and
provider-token cancellation independent of the worker I/O runtime. Kernel tests
compare results and numeric errors with the scalar evaluator.

The independent-file integration fixtures are written by PyArrow, with Snappy,
SQL nulls, multiple row groups, and dictionary and plain encodings. Native tests
infer and decode every row. The production end-to-end test additionally creates
an attachment without an explicit schema, checks HTTP projections, aggregates,
joins (including a dynamically filtered probe) and compatible windows, streams all rows with psycopg, checks read-only rejection,
and repeats reads after a cold process restart. Run it from `zig/` with:

```sh
ANTFLY_BIN="$PWD/zig-out/bin/antfly" uv run --project e2e/antfly --extra lake pytest e2e/antfly/test_lake_sql.py -n 0
```

The filesystem fixture wraps the independently generated Parquet payload in
Antfly's existing object-store envelope; `file://` is that provider's namespace.
Iceberg rename tests separately verify equality deletes resolve field IDs in
both data and delete files rather than trusting physical column names.

The native batch interface is internal, not Apache Arrow. Retained join payloads,
join keys and grouping keys use typed primitive columns with packed SQL-null
validity. Rows are reconstructed at candidate/expression/result boundaries.
Complex JSON and heterogeneous columns retain native JSON values rather than
converting exact integers to doubles. Aggregate state uses one compact vector
per aggregate: counts, i128 sums, compensated floating sums/means, booleans and
typed extrema. DISTINCT, pattern sets and complex extrema retain their explicit
dynamic ownership. Legacy variable-width join inputs preserve their row widths.

Sort and top-K comparisons cache fixed 32-byte normalized prefixes. Signed
integers, finite floats, booleans and escaped byte strings use memcomparable
encodings; NULL placement and direction remain explicit. Exact type-layout
metadata prevents mixed integer/float shortcuts, signed zero is canonicalized,
and truncated/complex comparisons fall back to the scalar comparator. Original
keys remain available for exact ties, peer detection and spill interoperability.

Nonrecursive equijoins install immutable composite Bloom/range evidence in a
supported direct probe scan after the build completes and before its first
pull. Filters are skipped on preserved probe sides of outer joins and for
computed keys. Lake cursors apply Bloom evidence before producing selected
cells; range evidence also prunes files, row groups and Iceberg partitions
through the existing field-ID-aware planner. Unknown physical statistics remain
residual. Empty builds need no probe data decoding. The exact hash join and ON
residual still decide every returned match, and borrowed evidence outlives pulls.

Window requirements with compatible ORDER BY prefixes and identical partition
keys share the strongest permutation when their consumers are peer-invariant.
Each weaker requirement builds its own peer/group boundaries. Navigation,
ROWS frames, order-sensitive exclusions, floating sums and complex extrema
retain independent stable tie ordering. Both in-memory and spilled execution
use the same compatibility plan.

Expression stripes, Parquet decoding, speculative prefetch and spill writers
share one native admission scheduler: at most eight asynchronous tasks and
64 MiB of reserved staging/workspace across statements. Expression pages of at
least 1,024 selected rows split into at most four independent stripes. Required
work executes inline under saturation; speculative prefetch yields. Allocator
admission is serialized, and task leases release only after await/cancel joins
workers, including cancellation before start. Statement memory/disk budgets
remain separate from this global concurrency allowance. This uses the existing
I/O runtime rather than creating independent pools for each operator.

Window inputs spill as bounded column blocks with disk directories and a
four-block decode cache. Key sorting and frame arguments load only requested
columns; window outputs retain the shared cell sidecar. Spill I/O buffers and
execution chunks scale with the statement memory quota. Native execution chunks
have a 4,096-row upper bound, independent of response-page size.

Large eligible lake scans can split into ordered ranges whose workers run the
complete scan/filter/projection pipeline. Multi-file ranges discover footers
lazily and own independent mutable object versions. Bounded typed queues apply backpressure;
the consumer preserves source order and delivers valid rows before a later
worker error. Early closure and cancellation join workers before
releasing the parent snapshot. LIMIT/OFFSET, small scans/budgets, external decision
expressions and scheduler saturation use the existing serial pipeline.
Homogeneous hash keys compare retained primitive columns directly; batch hashing
avoids transposing Datum rows and probing interleaves independent bucket chains.

The local key-only window fixture measured about 20x lower elapsed time with
column blocks across three samples. Physical reads decreased by about 32% for
its repeated, compressed 8 KiB payloads. These numbers measure decoding and local
spill reads, not total query throughput. Raw samples and the existing join
comparison cases are recorded in
[`native-lake-column-pipeline-refinements.json`](../zig/bench/baselines/native-lake-column-pipeline-refinements.json).

Further tuning includes richer statistics-driven costing, runtime filters
through derived/computed scan mappings, and more parallel aggregate/join
pipelines. Current scalar and spill fallbacks preserve supported SQL semantics.

`EXPLAIN` identifies `Lake Scan`; verbose plans include the source format and
configured snapshot selector without opening the source. Unsupported Parquet
encodings fail through the existing lake engine. Source attachments reject native write constraints, relational schema indexes, defaults,
generated columns and TTL. SQL mutations and public batches reject writes;
existing native tables cannot acquire or remove an attachment through a schema
update. External scans reject native serializable range-proof requests and
active row policies or row filters. Public secondary-index cursors and explicit
collations are unsupported. Lake sidecar and operational engine APIs remain the
existing standalone interfaces.

### Native lake aggregate publication and reuse

External tables accept opt-in indexes. Public aggregate recipes can be included
in the table's `indexes` at creation or added through the existing index endpoint:

```json
{
  "type": "algebraic",
  "derive_from_schema": true,
  "aggregates": [
    {"name": "rows", "op": "count"},
    {"name": "amount_total", "op": "sum", "measure": "amount"}
  ]
}
```

HTTP and MCP creation infer the schema first, then expand and persist the same
canonical index definition used by installation and publication. Public recipes
remain catalog provenance; the storage engine receives its strict runtime
configuration. Each index accepts at most 64 recipes, and external-table admission
checks the shared 4,096-declaration directory ceiling before committing definitions.

Native metadata protocol 23 stores a checksum, length and immutable artifact
reference for the publication directory, rather than embedding every declaration
in the 256 KiB catalog record. The directory is bounded to 16 MiB; legacy inline
catalogs remain readable. Directory and inventory bytes use the shared verified
memory/disk cache after fresh source, credential and store validation. Source
object checks run in batches of up to eight through the shared scheduler; cached
payloads do not replace fresh provider evidence.

Builds renew their five-minute ownership lease with a separate heartbeat. A lost
or ambiguous metadata CAS is terminal and is never replayed. Provider cancellation
callbacks perform no metadata writes. Upload completion takes an owned snapshot of
the latest fence and publishes through an exact table-definition CAS. The build
request has a separate 24-hour deadline, and closing joins the heartbeat and all
speculative reads before releasing their owners.

Compatible recipes share a scan and typed blocks. SQL readers authenticate each
logical root, then decode matching cohort blocks once and map their states into
requested reducer slots. Independently ordered materializations retain sparse
composition. Exact integer/count/boolean lake aggregation can also use row-group
workers; floating sums and averages retain their ordered reductions.

Unchanged aggregate roots survive definition-only updates when the complete
source/schema, credentials, store and recipe proofs match. Exact mergeable recipes
also persist per-file contributions inside the directory. A changed-source build
merges authenticated states for unchanged versioned files and scans only new or
changed files. File proofs include source/schema identity, URI, provider versions,
byte length and exact typed recipe. Contributions are retained only for live files
and desired recipes, with at most 16,384 entries. Deletion-bearing sources,
floating keys/extrema and non-associative floating reductions use the complete
scan; they do not inherit contributions under a weaker proof. The real PyArrow
E2E regression covers 320 inline recipes, append rebuilds, unchanged contribution
identities, HTTP/pgwire results, selected-artifact corruption and cold restart.

Published and queryable remain separate states. Native exact aggregates and
ordered relational indexes become queryable after current source proof and
reader-contract verification. Remote `CREATE INDEX` and the relational index
API use the schema definition as their durable build obligation; publication is
asynchronous and readiness is explicit. Remote tables remain read-only for row
mutations and unsupported constraints.

Ordered indexes use the native tuple encoder, expression evaluator, NULL
placement and partial-index membership rules. Shared delete-aware source scans
feed bounded native sort/spill runs into immutable authenticated B+tree pages.
A key has a physical file/group/row tie, so equal tuples retain distinct rows.
SQL equality prefixes can select these indexes automatically, with a scan
fallback only before an artifact is selected. Explicit row queries require a
ready publication, preserve index order across bounded hydration windows and
return exclusive cursors fenced by schema, index semantics and immutable root.
Integers do not cross floating point. Direct key columns and `INCLUDE` columns
are retained in native column blocks; fully covered projections and residuals
read those blocks without Parquet data-page hydration. Other queries prune
unselected files, row groups and pages and preserve Iceberg delete filtering.
Authenticated page/block reads share the scoped persistent lake cache, whose
contents never replace current source or authorization proof.

Cold lake serving uses a server-owned, single-worker `std.Io` persistence lane,
independent of request/provider executor capacity. Shutdown drains accepted
writes before releasing its executor and resource manager. Keep the configured
`lake_cache.root` on persistent local storage with a single process owner to
reuse authenticated ranges across restarts. Cache availability is optional:
missing local paths, ownership contention, startup failures and resource pressure
must not become source authority or query readiness failures.

A failed disk-tier initialization is retried opportunistically by a later
request after a 30-second backoff. No request sleeps during backoff, and a
successful owner is published exactly once with acquire/release synchronization
for readers already serving from RAM/source. Initialization attempt/failure
counters expose repeated recovery failures; a successful retry clears the
current unavailability reason. This permits recovery from temporary owner-lock
contention without requiring another server restart. It does not repair invalid
configuration or guarantee a hit for data read while persistence was unavailable.

The data-server metrics expose `antfly_lake_cache_disk_ready`, initialization
failure reasons, disk/mapping hits, provider reads/bytes, asynchronous write
errors, queue depth and policy/queue/memory/capacity/allocation/closing drops.
Source capture, publication loading, index acquisition, ranking, hydration,
highlighting and total query timings are reported separately. Phase times can
overlap (for example index acquisition inside ranking/highlighting); do not sum
them as exclusive elapsed time. Public lake `took_ms` includes cold setup rather
than starting only after publication/index preparation. Provider cache counters
describe payload reads, not all GCS HTTP attempts, metadata requests or retries.

Seekable text readers coalesce a fully requested, authenticated 1 MiB pack into
one GET instead of four 256 KiB GETs without increasing transferred bytes.
Partial cold reads retain 256 KiB units; a cached pack can satisfy those units
without a provider read, including after restart. Prefetch admits at most four
units/packs concurrently (at most 4 MiB of source bytes), charges scheduler
memory, shares singleflight keys with required reads and joins cancellation.
Both pack and constituent-unit digests remain enforced.

Native text artifact metadata version 9 records stored projection coverage when
an index opts in to source storage. Single-text-source typed result pages use that coverage
proof and native row identity to hydrate covered fields directly from the text
snapshot. Uncovered display/source fields still use the shared delete-aware
Parquet cursor. Mixed/composed sources without one proven text identity retain
physical hydration. This adds build/storage work proportional to the indexed
source projection, not the whole source document. Existing text publications
need a format refresh; reconciliation checks artifact format even when schema
and source signatures have not changed. Retained older roots remain understood
by garbage collection until their reader leases and retirement obligations end.

Local regression evidence: a complete 1 MiB pack needs one provider request,
an isolated cold read transfers 256 KiB, a persisted pack supplies a sparse
post-restart read with zero provider requests/bytes, and fully covered typed
hydration opens no Parquet cursor. These are deterministic local fixtures, not
live GCS latency measurements. To verify a deployment, run the same highlighted
query cold, wait for queue depth to reach zero (and check write errors/drops),
restart against the same cache root, then compare results, elapsed time, cache
metrics and actual GCS request/byte telemetry. Authorization and mutable source
metadata can still require remote validation on a warm cache.

Cold-query qualification separates persistent-byte reuse from decoded runtime
warmup. Server request-stat snapshots include `lake_range_cache` and
`lake_disk_cache`; data/standalone health endpoints expose the matching
`antfly_lake_cache_*`, `antfly_lake_disk_cache_*`, and
`antfly_lake_query_phase_nanoseconds_total` Prometheus metrics. Inspect
`disk_unavailable`, `disk_init_attempts`, and `disk_init_failures` before treating
an empty disk directory as a query performance problem. Optional disk startup
failures preserve RAM/source reads and retry after a 30-second awake-clock
cooldown. Concurrent requests do not wait behind cache inventory startup.
The disk counters include `write_errors`, `last_write_error`, `writes_dropped`,
`queued_entries`, and `writes_completed`, distinguishing a failed worker write
from bounded admission or a write that has not yet drained. A disabled cache or
an enabled cache without a resolvable root does not start a disk owner; configure
`lake_cache.root` explicitly when the node has no local storage base directory.

To qualify a deployment, issue the same highlighted query against one pinned
publication, wait for queued writes to drain, and record provider requests/bytes,
disk hits, and elapsed time. Restart using the same persistent cache volume and
credentials and repeat, then separately repeat with an empty cache directory.
Compare counter deltas on an otherwise idle node: shared cache traffic counters
are not per-request attribution. Completed indexed-search queries also accumulate
publication, search, hydration, delivery, and total nanoseconds without query-log
spam. Hydration is nested inside search/delivery, so these counters must not all
be summed. Decoded structures still rebuild after restart; persisted immutable
artifacts and Parquet ranges can be reused. This procedure is deployment
qualification, not a claim that a particular GCS startup failure is diagnosed.

Cold Parquet reads transfer verified object-response ownership without another
body copy and reuse a header probe when it already contains the complete page.
The projected-page restart regression asserts four cold provider requests and
zero additional requests after reopening the same disk cache with the provider
unavailable, while excluding a 512-KiB unselected column. This is deterministic
request-count evidence, not a latency benchmark.

Full-text indexes can opt in to duplicated source with
`{"type":"full_text","field":"body","store_source":true}`. The default is
false. Native seekable segments retain only the indexed source projection:
`field` limits it to that field, while a default-projection index retains its
projected source. This increases storage and build work, but eligible single
text queries can highlight directly from authenticated stored-source blocks
without adding the body to the Parquet display projection. Explicit highlight
fields outside that projection and named/mixed-query cases keep the existing
Parquet path. Fields still needed for display, ranking, or filtering are not
pruned. Source duplication participates in the immutable build recipe, so older
unattested artifacts fall back to Parquet until rebuilt. The highlight-source
regression removes the Parquet object after pinning/building and verifies native
source hydration, highlighting, and deadline propagation; it does not bypass
the API's current-source/publication authorization checks or claim that a fresh
API request can succeed with its required source proof unavailable.

Reader authority lives in native metadata independently of definition CAS.
One renewable publication lease per process/session amortizes concurrent reads,
protects an old generation across replacement and DROP, and fences every cache
read when renewal fails. Lifecycle rows and retained roots survive DROP and
native metadata snapshots. Retirement atomically closes new reader admission;
a bounded collector marks directories, inventories, contributions and all
aggregate, graph and ordered-index descendants before its scoped upload census.
It preserves pending upload attempts, supports a dry run and resumes the exact
retirement cut after interruption. A delete budget cannot prematurely release
retained roots. Deleting old attempt namespaces alone is unsafe.

Retained publications record a physical store locator and a named connection,
without copying credentials into metadata. Reopening resolves current credentials
and rejects a connection redirected to another endpoint, root, bucket or prefix.
A paginated native metadata work feed includes DROP tombstones. Protocol 24 and
25 publications declare their reader contract; collection preserves legacy roots
and all upload generations below the first leased attempt, including temporary
files. A protocol upgrade alone cannot prove old readers have drained.

The durable table incarnation has a random upload namespace. Collection cannot
cross into another incarnation sharing a store and table number. Store bindings
are recorded when an attempt is admitted, so failed builds and DROP before the
first publication still leave enumerable cleanup obligations. A successful sweep
forgets only its own unused binding; credential rotations retain the other stores.
Historical metadata recovery rechecks the durable publication directory and
rebuilds missing derived storage instead of treating a matching signature as
proof that collected artifacts remain available.

Table backup manifests preserve schema and index rebuild obligations rather
than publication authority. Restore creates an unpublished external table and
rebuilds against its authorized source. The shared native text executor accepts
an owned immutable corpus snapshot, with the same global BM25 statistics, typed
ordering and missing-row filtering as its local storage provider.

Native remote text publication uses the local field projector and segment
builder, including positions and typed values. A bounded process corpus cache
constructs global statistics once per immutable root. Warm snapshots hold
authenticated pinned disk mappings; eviction waits for their leases, while cache
damage is a miss. Publication leases and source/credential checks remain
query-owned authority. Corpus metadata, schema arenas, decoded statistics and
cold payloads share a 256 MiB process heap budget across entries; the encoded
corpus limit remains 512 MiB. Idle entries yield under memory pressure, and
active readers keep their pinned payloads.

Native sparse publication retains the existing sparse index’s exact LSM
manifest and immutable runs. Native dense publication retains HBC posting
authority, its exact committed WAL prefixes, and a separately pinned LSM plane
of canonical float32 vectors. Both reopen through the existing native storage
port over independently authenticated 256 KiB artifact blocks. Native ranking,
constraints, adaptive candidate refill, and named-source fusion remain in the
shared executors. Dense exact-vector loads use sorted batched LSM lookups and
caller-owned decode buffers; physical document delivery also batches rows.
Read-only HBC recovery neither creates directories nor repairs WAL tails, and
rejects mutation before writing. Request runtimes share process memory admission
and enforce a 256 MiB per-request native heap limit. GC marks every retained
file block, including the dense exact-vector source plane.

Artifact collection runs on a separate bounded cleanup scheduling owner, drains
before reader/cache teardown, and enumerates DROP tombstones through native
metadata. Configure `lake_indexes.artifact_gc` with `enabled`, `dry_run`,
`interval_ms`, `max_deleted`, `max_marked`, and `max_read_bytes`. Defaults enable
one pass every 30 seconds with at most 4096 deletes, 262144 marked artifacts and
512 MiB of root reads. Dry runs report eligible/deleted counts without changing
authority or objects. Legacy generations remain protected rather than inferring
an old-reader drain from a protocol upgrade.

Native remote text HTTP execution passes a real Parquet regression over several
native segments, scored offset pages, physical hydration, adjacent exact integers
above 2^53, and cold restart. Named text sources use the shared composition
executor. Ordered search pages carry `remote_snapshot` alongside the ordinary
sort tuple; replay must echo that token and a changed publication fails closed.
The token grants no access and does not retain artifacts. The Parquet HTTP
regression checks score-sort continuation across restart and rejection of
missing or stale snapshot tokens. The real Parquet fixture also verifies native
dense nearest neighbors, exact sparse dot-product scores, sparse residual filters
over integers above 2^53, combined text/dense/sparse fusion, physical hydration,
and vector search across restart. Public graph searches and search aggregations are
not routed through these adapters; SQL algebraic materializations retain their
existing native consumer path. Native dense generation metadata is reopened per
request within its heap budget; a shared detached generation cache and streamed
contiguous native-file mappings remain further optimization work.
Constant-time Iceberg coverage also requires
an explicit immutable-object proof, rather than trusting a snapshot label or a
TTL.

### Pre-merge activation work

Standalone ordinary FK publication now uses the durable native owner-control
path, with operation receipts separate from Raft applied watermarks. Catalog,
schema, receipt and fence release are committed together. The linked native
regressions pass initial self-FK publication, ordinary DROP/ADD and reparenting
to two external parent owners, lost source/install replies, cold restart and
canceled hidden-owner retirement (three tests). Two additional native storage
tests pass receipt replay and old-schema pinning through restart. Initial
external-parent CREATE, including MATCH PARTIAL support-index publication, now
passes valid/orphan/protected-parent writes, cold restart and deterministic
cancellation in native standalone. Schema finalization uses an exact durable
node/store/root binding and owner progress, never synthetic Raft placements.
Copied foreign owner bindings do not authorize native publication. This does
not enable that lifecycle on hot-standby deployments without explicit adoption.
The linked native activation suite now passes six tests, including public
external-FK/graph TRUNCATE and cold reopen, plus three repeat runs (18 checks)
without skips or leaks. Restore authority cancellation checks run outside the
metadata mutex; test mutations that require immediate phase-two delivery ask
for write-level acknowledgement rather than the API's proposal-only default.

The same work fixes parent receipt validation for non-first owner ranges and
keeps ordinary owner ACKs off the full-catalog decode path: a revision-checked
point read advances an unchanged projection, while publication or concurrent
catalog changes require the complete immutable snapshot refresh.

Authenticated retirement summaries now use a transactional compressed Patricia
tree, with immutable-value hashes, canonical roots, protected keys and bounded
handoff/GC admission. Eighteen focused tests pass, including native abort,
restart, owner transfer and two-phase GC. In the local Debug benchmark, 10,000
summary point reads took 14.3–16.5 ms. This trades write cost for predictable
reads: at 512 records with insertion batches of 64, measured insert WAL was
741,238 bytes versus 437,920 without the tree (1.69x), and GC WAL was 272,162
versus 46,752 bytes (5.82x). These are small local fixtures, not production
throughput claims or a claim of reduced write amplification.

Standalone and bound-primary hot-standby row-policy publication pass two linked
native tests, including ordered metadata/owner replay and cold reopen. This
does not yet prove the complete promoted-primary failover matrix. The catalog
suite passes 146 tests, and the distributed transaction contract suite passes
102 tests.

Durable idle HTTP connections pass eight focused tests, including authenticated
public handler calls for settings, commit/rollback, DISCARD, prepared-resource
retirement and ownership checks. External-parent and graph TRUNCATE are enabled
through the public route without private test permits. The installed recovery
binary passes 16 tests without skips or leaks (five mounted real-listener
scenarios, two focused contracts and nine import anchors); the SQL boundary
suite passes 69 tests, including rejection of a missing parent admission proof
and unsupported native source/parent receipt authority before job admission.
These results do not establish release readiness for the entire SQL feature.
The TypeScript connection helpers use generated request/response schemas and
bounded, non-retrying SQL transport; the SDK SQL suite passes 30 tests.
The complete TypeScript SDK suite passes 396 tests with one conditional bundle
check skipped.
Follow-up SQL gate repair: `zig build sql-test` now uses the scoped native SQL
imports and compiles the SQL and row-policy contract namespaces by default;
269 tests pass, including a high-fanout join allocation-budget regression.
The parity-style `SQL original` filter passes 12 tests, rather than silently
selecting none. Connection-bound prepared resources can now be closed by the
Python and TypeScript SDKs with the required connection header; focused SQL
SDK suites pass 22 and 31 tests respectively, with TypeScript typechecking.
Full Python and TypeScript SDK suites pass 257 and 397 tests respectively
(one conditional TypeScript bundle check skipped).
The hash-join iterator reuses its candidate scratch across output rows. In a
local ReleaseSafe A/B measurement of the 65,536-pair residual-join fixture,
backing allocations fell from 68,120 to 2,585 (96.2%), cumulative allocated
bytes from 123,311,135 to 96,572,855, and peak tracked memory remained about
1.29 MB. The fixture aggregates its 32,640 matches to isolate join processing
from result materialization. Reproduce the allocation budget with
`zig build sql-test -Doptimize=safe -- --test-filter 'SQL high fanout join'`.
These allocator measurements are not production-throughput evidence or a
complete release gate.

Direct-field dense/sparse vectors now have bounded, resumable snapshot transport
and ordered tail coverage, including oversized historical base artifacts on
full-text-only tables. The focused vector suite passes 15 tests; its 13 storage
tests also pass five additional runs (65 checks) without skips or leaks.
The same 15 tests pass with production admission enabled and test permits
removed. Ordered-artifact compatibility passes 13 tests, portable backup 39,
retained effects 32, and transaction reservations 49. Graph/enrichment/resolver
asynchronous tails remain unsupported.

The next activation cut is still in progress. Ordered-artifact regressions now
pass 54 tests, including durable stale-publication rejection, ambiguous commit
recovery without replay-sequence reuse, owned preparation outside the apply
lock, binary-safe catalog transport, and attempt-bound immutable source layouts.
The graph transfer contract preserves source bytes for receipt verification and
rebinds physical generations using separately authenticated receiver layouts;
the wider source protocol is not advertised yet. Certified source-copy graph
ownership blocks are included in the transferable source-cut digest; omitting
or changing those bytes changes the certificate. Retained-transfer regressions
pass 28 tests, including source-certificate block binding, graph-bearing pinned
source export/reopen/import, oversized frames,
bounded spool caching, authenticated
cold reads, partial-copy corruption repair and restart at exact row boundaries.
The compact publication upload codec and staging primitives now pass retry,
ordered-age pruning, tombstone and allocation-failure checks. These primitives
are not yet connected to the complete Raft/standby upload/finalize path.
Malformed producer graph effects become durable invalid-output rejections;
resource failures and persisted-catalog errors remain failures, not success.
Actual producer integration, complete baseline/provenance admission, historical
proof transfer/adoption, large-publication runtime transport and the full
graph/enrichment/resolver recovery matrix remain activation gates.
These passing foundations are not evidence that those families are enabled.

Sparse immutable segments now bind postings and document maps to per-document
incarnations, preventing stale scores after stable-ordinal replacement and late
compaction publication. Sidecars are point-addressed, query caches are bounded,
and selected compaction inputs are reserved before allocation. The sparse suite
passes 24 tests, including replacement, restart, compaction races, metadata
retirement, corruption and budget denial. A fixed-capacity preflight cache
avoids charging repeated terms for identical document metadata; collisions
conservatively overcount. These are correctness and bounded-work checks, not a
large-scale throughput benchmark.

Native checkpoint capture now waits for an in-flight immutable-table build and
drains the committed mutable tail before exporting its manifest. Previously a
background flush could make the drain yield, producing a self-contained image
without committed retention metadata. Explicit checkpoint admission no longer
overrides the shared maintenance budget. Three checkpoint/backpressure tests
pass; the deterministic contested-cut export/reopen regression also passes ten
additional runs with no skips or leaks. This is correctness evidence, not a
checkpoint-latency benchmark.

The runtime suites pass 50 native implementation and 173 consumer tests. The
three deterministic production DataServer merge/split histories and the native
retirement regression also pass three repeat runs (12 checks), with no skips
or leaks. These cover UNIQUE/FK ownership, public writes, failover, restart and
exact-root cancellation. Native reconciliation and retirement now preserve
the existing storage owner rather than attaching a second opaque owner; cold
retirement reads use the same filesystem runtime.
Generation-transition rejection returns temporary unavailability without
claiming an aborted transaction or authorizing blind replay.

The final API runtime suite passes 338 tests, including shared native/document
restore, hidden handoff capability guards and generated route-policy coverage.
Both focused public write-unavailability regressions pass. The rebuilt mounted
TRUNCATE recovery binary passes all 16 tests after the hidden-owner routing fix;
these results do not rely on a previously built binary without the capability
checks.

The current inventory check still has 1,586 original cases: 103 implemented,
59 explicitly rejected, 43 superseded, and 1,381 unresolved dispositions.
Unresolved dispositions are not a count of distinct missing features. These
activation fixes do not replace the broader SQL parity/release gate.
The exact prepared UUID CREATE TABLE case now has mounted pgwire, durable
catalog snapshot/reopen, provisioned owner, and owner-restart row evidence.

## Integration status

The older initial-slice notes below are historical context, not the current
feature inventory. Current additions include:

- Ordinal-bound scalar programs, three-valued predicates, bounded top-K,
  grouped/global aggregates, HAVING, joins, derived tables and nonrecursive CTEs.
- Expression INSERT/UPDATE with whole-batch validation, exact integer values,
  and explicit SQL-null versus JSON-null provenance through native storage.
- Coordinated capture across local and remote owners and tables, with all capture
  fences released before paging. Alias cursors share capture but not position.
  Remote capture uses authenticated internal RPC, bounded owner leases and fresh
  quorum proofs. Durable owner-routed range protection is implemented below;
  deployment capabilities and TTL restrictions are explicit admission boundaries.
- Durable READ COMMITTED sessions, savepoints, read-your-writes overlays and
  native constraint/default/generated-row normalization. Repeatable-read and
  serializable sessions require explicitly capable providers, replicated range
  tracking and owner-fenced atomic prepare; unsupported providers reject BEGIN.
- Native catalog/schema/index/constraint DDL and durable pending/invalid
  receipts; pending activation/rewrite is not reported as synchronous success.
  ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY uses the metadata-owned non-null/unique
  fresh-generation rewrite. Mounted SQL verifies authorized pending receipts,
  successful publication, NULL/duplicate failure isolation, and data-owner
  restart persistence; broader schema-rewrite and restore gates remain separate.
  Uncertain restore admission now retains an idempotency key and deterministic
  job handle in the SQL receipt, with a non-success HTTP status and no-replay
  guidance rather than presenting an unconfirmed job as accepted.
- Generated HTTP clients, authenticated pgwire, a Lite C ABI, interactive CLI,
  and the Antfarm SQL workbench using the same execution contracts.

Set operations and typed INSERT-from-query are implemented with shared memory
admission and whole-statement validation before mutation. Full query-shape
parameter constraints propagate through nested derived queries, CTEs and sets
before programs are emitted. Relational RETURNING uses native normalization
under the schema fence and prepares all output before committing; DELETE
returns the version-fenced preimage. Native tests cover defaults and generated
values rather than reading rows back after the write.

Document reads now have declaration-derived shapes and retained native
transactions with bounded pages, TTL, authorization and typed projections.
Document INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE now use native validation and schema fences.
Updates preserve undeclared fields from the full raw preimage; exact-byte row
digests prevent stale writes even when custom TTL timestamps are unchanged.
RETURNING is prepared before commit, including SQL-null provenance.

Remote retained-read ownership now has bounded admission, incarnation/generation
tokens, sequence-fenced page borrowing, owned cancellation and periodic expiry.
Authenticated RPC mounting, client transport and distributed capture coordination
are implemented. Lost capture responses have scoped cleanup, rather than relying
only on lease expiry. Remote typed pages preserve exact integers, null provenance
and mutation preimages; native normalization remains the owner authority.
The bound single-table local source now pins multiple independent retained scan
views inside one short native statement-capture fence, after read-index preflight
and before releasing writers to resume. This supports local CTE/alias reads
without pretending separately opened cursors share a snapshot. That source
rejects guarded range-proof capture until it can supply owner-fenced proofs;
the provisioned distributed source retains its separate coordinated path.

Nonblocking pgwire queries now pull bounded pages, including nested derived
queries and CTEs, with network backpressure and immediate snapshot release on
completion/error. Portal admission and plan leases live with the cursor, not a
request stack. Blocking sorts/aggregates/windows retain bounded materialization.
Prepared identity manifests cover all physical tables in a relation plan.
CTE hints now have execution semantics: explicit `MATERIALIZED` and default
multiply referenced CTEs share one quota-bound typed producer, while
`NOT MATERIALIZED` retains separate inline scans. A repeated-reference test
checks physical scan counts and retained-row behavior; single-reference
unhinted CTEs stay pipelined. Default producer demand propagates backward
through inlined CTEs, so a multiply referenced downstream CTE does not
silently rescan an upstream automatic producer.

Window execution shares partition/order sorts, tracks peer boundaries, and uses
segment trees for moving aggregate frames. Ranking, offsets, value functions,
aggregates and ROWS/numeric RANGE frames preserve typed null/numeric semantics.
Internal aggregate nodes use wider numeric state; only requested SQL results are
range-checked. Omitted INSERT identities use the shared native secure row-ID
generator. Primary-identity ON CONFLICT actions use exact observed row fences.
Conflict-assignment scalar subqueries use a post-owner masked Apply: a direct,
uncorrelated scalar SELECT is evaluated only for rows that actually conflict
and satisfy DO UPDATE WHERE. Its point/range/absence reads use the same pinned
statement cut and commit read set as the owner arbitration. The earlier eager
INSERT-source capture was unsound because an untaken assignment could raise a
scalar error on a nonconflicting insert or a WHERE-false conflict. Conditional
or nested scalar subqueries, owner-correlated reads, and secondary-index
probes remain rejected until their demand masks and index membership proofs
can be preserved. Owner-local LSM snapshots fork delayed primary scans from
a bounded, route-fenced visibility cut. The distributed single-table primary
path now acquires every owner's write/replay fence, rejects unresolved
prepared intents, forks independent retained cursors while all fences are
held, and releases the fences before paging. It binds the schema version and
every owner/absence proof to the same guarded commit; unsupported multi-table
or non-primary delayed shapes remain closed.
Existing conflict-owner point reads now use reclaimed cursor and page scratch
per owner, resetting page scratch after empty progress pages. A 32-owner batch
with three 64 KiB native continuation pages per owner fits a 512 KiB SQL
memory admission budget while retaining all normalized images and
version/claim guards for one atomic commit; page and cursor storage no longer
accumulates with owners or progress pages. Conflict point pages now consume one
batch-wide page quota rather than restarting the allowance for every owner;
captured INSERT-source pages and conflict pages still have separate admission.
Ordinary composite-unique targets now use the native tuple codec, activation
coverage, generation identity and durable compare-claim observations; those
observations survive session merging and savepoints. Lite uses native durable
transaction prepare/commit for single-handle constraint expansion, including
self-referencing foreign-key actions. It rejects out-of-handle dependencies.

Equality-correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS and scalar subqueries lower to grouped
hash joins under the same coordinated capture as their outer query. Scalar
cardinality, NULL equality and hidden-column projection are checked explicitly.
Single-column IN/NOT IN subqueries now use bounded grouped membership and NULL
evidence under that same capture. Empty sets, duplicate values, nullable operands
and correlated NULL groups retain three-valued SQL semantics. Computed side-local
join operands bind as hash keys rather than quadratic residual comparisons.
ANY/SOME/ALL comparisons use grouped extrema and null/count evidence, including
empty sets and all six comparison operators. Correlated EXISTS supports one
ordered comparison alongside equality keys using MIN/MAX evidence. Computed
OR-correlated EXISTS predicates distribute into at most eight independently
grouped/ordered witness branches under the same capture; local-only OR filters
stay intact to avoid needless scans. NOT EXISTS negates the combined Boolean
result, including when inner comparisons encounter NULL. Nested local
membership subqueries lower within the independently bound inner child;
lexical aliases shadow the outer query as usual, while qualified references
escaping past that child's scope are rejected. Computed
outer keys and composed scalar aggregates are decorrelated without per-row
remote queries. Discarded EXISTS projections are fully bound but never evaluated
or retained as scan dependencies. Uncorrelated value subqueries preserve complete
set/group/window/CTE/top-K semantics through independently bound derived-query
boundaries. Multiple correlated ranges, correlated set/group/window/top-K forms,
and lazy outer subquery branches remain unsupported.

Quantified LIKE/ILIKE subqueries use a distinct, quota-accounted pattern set
per correlation key rather than the ordered-comparison MIN/MAX shortcut.
The inner source is captured once, while the step-limited scalar matcher folds
ANY/SOME/ALL (including per-pattern NOT forms) with SQL empty-set and NULL
semantics. Empty global aggregates contain no synthetic NULL member; large
sets use external DISTINCT and reusable disk state when spilling is enabled.
Without spill I/O they retain the memory quota. Arbitrary pattern matching still has a
bounded per-outer-row probe cost rather than an index shortcut. Pattern state
is allocated only for this internal aggregate; the ordinary 10,000-row grouped
benchmark stays below 2 KiB of operator state. Pattern and operand
parameters infer string independently of the aggregate's JSON result type.

Named WINDOW definitions resolve in query-local scopes before publication of the
immutable AST. Inheritance restrictions and unused definitions are validated
without evaluating discarded expressions. GROUPS frames use indexed peer-group
boundaries; EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW/GROUP/TIES/NO OTHERS produces at most three
intervals, shared by indexed aggregates and constant-interval value selection.

Targetless ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING now coordinates primary identity and every
supported immediate unique arbiter. Only admitted candidates reserve in-batch
claims, so skipped rows cannot suppress later valid rows. Native schema and
generation fences still cover the complete atomic mutation.

Explicit ON CONFLICT targets now infer partial unique indexes through a bounded
typed predicate proof shared with native index membership. The admitted SQL
shape is a conjunction of column/literal comparisons and IS [NOT] NULL; claim
generation checks the predicate against typed old/new rows. Typed expression
keys share the native tuple VM, dependency projections, activation and retirement
machinery. Explicit expression targets use order-independent equality-key
identity, and expression/predicate changes fence the durable claim generation.
Deferrable ON CONFLICT arbiters remain deliberately rejected, matching
[PostgreSQL's immediate-arbiter contract](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-insert.html).
Ordinary deferrable UNIQUE declarations now share the native claim authority.
Statement validation honors durable timing overrides; final commit validates
the complete final overlay, including swaps. SET CONSTRAINTS IMMEDIATE validates
retroactively before publishing its mode change. Savepoints and restart preserve
the timing state. Deferrable UNIQUE keys are not eligible FK parent targets.

Joined UPDATE/FROM and DELETE/USING (including explicit joins and CTE sources)
carry target versions and document digests through one statement capture. All
images and RETURNING values are prepared before native atomic commit. Equality
conjuncts expose hash keys; overwritten columns are not loaded. Multiple source
matches for an UPDATE target fail with SQLSTATE 21000 rather than arbitrarily
choosing a row. DELETE deduplicates target images before the mutation quota.

Linear recursive CTEs use a delta worklist, typed UNION DISTINCT visited keys,
one capture of physical sources, and reusable static-side hash indexes. Seed
types determine recursive outputs; explicit casts supply widening. Mutual or
nonlinear recursion, recursive aggregates/windows and nullable-side self joins
remain explicit unsupported shapes. This is not unrestricted recursive SQL.

Pgwire SQL PREPARE/EXECUTE/DEALLOCATE shares the existing bounded wire-protocol
prepared registry and binding-identity fences. Statements survive transaction
commit and release on deallocation/disconnect. EXECUTE evaluates typed scalar
arguments in an empty binding environment, never interpolating SQL or opening
table readers; JSON null remains distinct from SQL NULL. Eligible executions
use the existing backpressured pull stream. SQL-language
DECLARE/FETCH/MOVE/CLOSE cursors retain that same bounded pull stream under the
connection owner. Blocking read shapes that decline pull execution instead
execute once into a quota-bound typed cursor spool before DECLARE publishes
the name; a failed quota check cannot expose a partial cursor. Materialized
FETCH never reexecutes SQL and rechecks current authority and the original
binding in the pinned lookup namespace. DECLARE is transaction-bound, pins its binding identity and
transaction read-your-writes overlay, and stages stronger-isolation range proofs
before releasing transaction admission. FETCH pages are bounded and flushed
before another page is pulled; exhausted, failed, closed, committed and
disconnected cursors release their stream. SCROLL uses a quota-bound lazy typed
spool. WITH HOLD drains under the original transaction before COMMIT and detaches
only after confirmed commit; ambiguous commit never publishes a held cursor.
Held fetches recheck current authority and pinned source identity. These cursors
are connection-owned, not restart-durable. HTTP exposes durable prepare/execute/close resources,
independent of transaction commit, with principal/owner checks, expiry, bounded
admission and immutable binding manifests. Execution reads one resource in a
read-only transaction; create/close/expiry atomically maintain compact admission
metadata. Resources survive restart on the owning node; failover to another
owner is explicitly rejected instead of silently retargeting the statement.

Pgwire SET/LOCAL/SHOW/RESET supports bounded `statement_timeout`, bounded
UTF-8 `application_name`, a bounded ordered `search_path` of authorized namespaces, and the
immutable negotiated UTF-8 `client_encoding`.
`SET NAMES` uses the same UTF-8-only connection-owned path.
`RESET ALL` resets those connection-owned settings with transaction/savepoint
semantics in simple and extended protocol. Writable dotted `app.*` definitions
now have typed pgwire overlays from the durable catalog, while policy-sensitive
definitions cannot be set by the client. Original case `sql-0045` remains
unresolved until exact mounted parity evidence covers the complete catalog
setting/session behavior.
Outside a transaction, `DISCARD ALL` additionally closes connection-owned
prepared plans, portals and held cursors after the command reply; original
case `sql-0047` also remains unresolved pending full catalog-setting parity.
Settings obey transaction and savepoint
restoration. Lookup namespace is separate from immutable transaction ownership;
prepared statements and held cursors retain their original namespace.
`$user` expansion and unrelated settings fail explicitly. Ordered namespace
fallback advances only on exact table absence, not authorization or other errors.
All pgwire describe, execute, simple-stream and extended-portal paths classify
connection-owned settings through the same typed command boundary, so a setting
cannot accidentally open a SQL storage cursor.

Dry-run EXPLAIN now binds the inner query or mutation under its real authority
and renders bounded text or versioned JSON from the immutable bound plan. It
does not open a row cursor or execute a mutation. The exact original text and
`FORMAT JSON, VERBOSE, COSTS OFF` read cases pass mounted HTTP. The exact
original INSERT explanation also passes mounted HTTP with a post-request row
count proving no write. The exact UPDATE-with-membership-subquery and cross-table
MERGE explanations pass mounted HTTP with no read capture or distributed commit
attempt. Target-only UPDATE predicate/assignment and DELETE predicate subqueries
now use the same decorrelated, snapshot-captured joined-mutation path, with
linear read work tested at 1,024 rows; mutation-plan
authorization and zero-I/O behavior have component coverage. ANALYZE and
fabricated cost estimates fail explicitly; the remaining original EXPLAIN
forms still need case-specific evidence.

Multi-row `INSERT ... VALUES` scalar subqueries now use the bounded INSERT-source
path, including self-table reads, typed literal coercion, and pre-commit
cardinality errors. The compiler, type inference, and execution binding now
use a flat VALUES source with ordered arms; cross-arm parameter inference uses
a balanced expression tree, not a UNION plan. Adjacent literal-only arms share
one typed row block, and only one nonliteral arm iterator is active at a time.
The 1,000-row test executes within 4 MiB and a 1 MiB admission limit rejects
before mutation. Grouped Top-K now caps its reservation by actual group count,
so a scalar source no longer reserves thousands of unused output slots.
In the same Debug SQL fixture, that INSERT's peak fell from 8.49 MB to
2.54 MB. The 512-row membership fixture fell from about 7.80 MB to
1.51 MB, and the ordered subquery fixture from about 7.47 MB to 1.23 MB;
these are local admission-memory observations, not throughput claims.
The original `sql-1410` self-read INSERT also has exact mounted HTTP evidence:
RETURNING reports its ID, and a subsequent typed read verifies the committed
status and quantity.
Table-reference parsing accepts ONLY across SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,
MERGE and TRUNCATE. With no table inheritance in this catalog it names the
same exact table; original `sql-1413` has mounted INSERT/RETURNING evidence.
Original `sql-0170` also has mounted parameterized SELECT evidence for
filtering, descending order and LIMIT over more than five matching rows.
The exact `sql-1531` point UPDATE also has mounted same-table scalar-source
evidence: it returns the target ID and a subsequent typed read verifies the
committed copied quantity. The joined-mutation component suite checks one
captured relational plan, cardinality, quota and read authorization.
The exact `sql-1532` parenthesized multi-column UPDATE has mounted evidence for
both committed cells. Explicit ROW and parenthesized tuple expressions lower
to the same simultaneous assignment plan; duplicate targets and arity mismatch
fail during compilation. A multi-column UPDATE row assignment now accepts an
explicit-width SELECT inside parentheses. It binds positional outputs through
one guarded mutation capture, checks scalar cardinality before commit, and
preserves the child's ORDER BY/LIMIT and aliases. A materialized typed row
producer supplies all positional assignments through one physical source scan;
SELECT * and correlation from inside the row source to the UPDATE
target remain outside this admitted shape. Scalar subqueries inside an
explicit ROW also remain supported.
UPDATE `DEFAULT`, including inside ROW, omits the old declared cell before
native normalization. A mounted relational test verifies the schema-provided
value in RETURNING alongside an incremented tuple member; relational and
document component tests preserve undeclared fields, keep one commit, and
abort without writes if native default preparation fails. A generated column
accepts only DEFAULT, so native preparation recomputes it; explicit values
remain rejected.
Joined relational mutations now carry a compact physical-presence token
alongside version and digest metadata. Projection alone maps both a missing
cell and SQL NULL to a null result; replacement images use that token to
preserve untouched omissions while explicit assignments retain their values.
A mounted tuple-UPDATE regression widens the table with an absent nullable
datetime and verifies the raw stored row remains sparse after commit, without
loading a full document preimage for every joined mutation.
INSERT DEFAULT VALUES and per-cell VALUES DEFAULT also omit cells for native
normalization, including mixed literal/scalar-subquery rows. The omission mask
keeps DEFAULT distinct from explicit SQL NULL through binding and RETURNING;
generated columns accept only DEFAULT and an omitted or defaulted `_id` uses
the native secure row-ID generator. Exact `sql-1494` has mounted evidence for
three schema-derived logical defaults and one affected row.
Typed `TIMESTAMPTZ '...'` literals use the datetime cast program, so offset
validation and UTC normalization happen before mutation admission. Exact
`sql-1496` has mounted native INSERT/RETURNING evidence. The adjacent
`sql-1495` `DEFAULT VALUES ... ON CONFLICT (id)` case now has mounted evidence
with an active coordinated UNIQUE claim: owner resolution selects the seeded
physical row, native preparation fences the claim, and RETURNING plus a
physical lookup verify the committed default-derived update.

Remaining major items include broader isolation deployment and fault validation,
broader correlated/mutation subqueries and MERGE, unrestricted recursion,
owned sequence support, broader retirement/promotion fault coverage, complete
route-wide policy/session validation, and the full parity, fault-injection and
workload benchmark gates. Hosted external-FK generation retirement and graph
dependency barriers, including native standalone receipts, have public activation/recovery evidence; they are
not blanket missing features. Passing focused component tests is not completion
of SQL extraction.

The mega-branch reference already implements parts of these gaps, but on its
older SQL adapter and native row-source contracts. In particular,
`sql/lower_dml.zig` and `api/sql_adapter_integration.zig` contain a literal-row
INSERT source with per-row scalar subqueries (including correlated and multi-row
cases); `api/table_writes/relational_mutation.zig` exercises recursive CTE
sources for joined mutations and MERGE; and `api/http_server.zig` plus
`api/auth_sql_adapter.zig` implement trusted role-setting hydration and native
row-policy checks. The old TRUNCATE path also parses CASCADE and RESTART
IDENTITY. These are behavioral references and test cases to port selectively,
not compatible modules to copy wholesale: the extraction now uses immutable
bound relations, retained statement capture, owner-fenced commits, and the
current catalog/constraint generations. No legacy adapter fallback should be
introduced to claim parity.

### Session catalog and policy-setting boundary: implemented core, incomplete activation

The original corpus includes `app.*` session variables, `current_setting`,
role/database defaults, RLS policies, `RESET ALL`, and `DISCARD ALL`. A pgwire
string map alone would be unsafe: policies must not silently trust a value a
client can change. The target shape uses a versioned setting registry in the
SQL catalog with typed values, role/database defaults, explicit write authority,
and an immutable request/session view. Each statement binds `current_setting`
against that view alongside its schema epoch; native policy evaluation and SQL
scalar programs must receive the same pinned view, including remote readers.
Transactions and savepoints journal setting overlays, and RESET/DISCARD operate
on that typed registry, not a separate pgwire-only map. Prepared plans retain
setting dependency identities while evaluating authorized values at execution.
Publication needs policy tests proving that unprivileged SET cannot widen row
visibility, plus rollback, failover, cross-owner, and plan-invalidation tests.
The implemented core is described below. Pgwire overlays remain
connection-scoped; broader original `app.*`/policy/RESET ALL/DISCARD ALL
contracts still require exact-case and deployment evidence, not another
independent pgwire setting map.

A typed, scoped setting snapshot/view pins names, identity generations,
role/database defaults, and authorized session overlays. Constant and SQL
scalar binding evaluate `current_setting('literal.name')` from that owner-captured
view, including joined expressions and pull streams. Missing capture, stale
generations, dynamic names, and client overlays on policy-sensitive values fail
closed. Metadata Raft now owns durable setting records, revision-fenced
publication, snapshot/import state, and an administrator-only public mutation
route. The production SQL adapter obtains authenticated scoped snapshots; SQL
SET changes only an authorized session overlay, never the durable registry.
Attached HTTP `/sql` sessions now accept typed dotted-name SET/SET LOCAL,
RESET and SHOW, plus RESET ALL, through the same complete-command parser as
pgwire. RESET ALL atomically clears the active and commit-time durable overlays;
savepoint rollback can restore them. It clears stale identities without a
catalog read, leaving the next statement to capture fresh defaults. The owner
keeps `SET LOCAL name = DEFAULT` transaction-local: it removes only the active
override and preserves the durable commit-time overlay across savepoint
rollback and restart; pgwire's session value resumes after transaction end. The owner
checks principal, lease, catalog generation and policy-sensitive write gates
before a durable overlay mutation; SHOW and `current_setting` read the active
overlay, including after a separately prepared statement is executed in the
session. HTTP PREPARE accepts `session_id` and holds the session execution lease
while it authenticates the principal, hydrates the database/namespace and
durable active setting overlay, describes the statement, and publishes the
immutable prepared resource. Such resources bind the exact session ID and
scoped setting-catalog epoch: execute rehydrates current values under its own
lease, refuses a different or ended session, and rejects a changed catalog.
The focused mounted test covers SET-before-PREPARE, a competing SET admission
probe at the exact describe catalog capture, later SET-before-execute,
authorization/scope denial, epoch change, and cold API-instance rehydration;
the durable-store test covers restart of both resource and attached session.
Pgwire now
holds typed, identity-fenced dotted-name overlays with SET/SET LOCAL/SHOW/RESET,
transaction/savepoint rollback, RESET ALL/DISCARD ALL, and prepared-plan epoch
checks. Pgwire overlays belong to one connection and are not restart-durable.
HTTP now also has durable, principal- and owner-bound idle connections with
typed setting overlays. An active transaction is attached by exact durable ID;
committed non-LOCAL settings carry back to the idle connection, while rollback
restores its prior overlay. HTTP `DISCARD ALL` atomically resets the idle
overlay, advances its generation and retires only that connection's prepared
resources; it refuses active or uncertain transactions. HTTP exposes no
connection-owned SQL cursor resource. A focused in-process public-handler
regression covers open, SET/SHOW, BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK, DISCARD, prepared
retirement, close and cross-principal denial. Cross-owner failover/security
workload gates remain open. A durable setting registry alone
is not policy parity. Schema-bound policy definitions survive catalog Raft
replay, snapshot/import, and table retirement. SQL CREATE/ALTER/DROP POLICY
edits drafts only; ENABLE/DISABLE requests a separate durable owner
publication. Owner-native reads and writes have signed principal/generation
proofs and fail-closed gates, but unsupported search, restore, and mutation
routes cannot bypass policy enforcement or make the feature generally ready.
The native standalone owner exercises publication, proofless-read denial,
signed reads and restart recovery. A bound-primary hot-standby owner also
exercises ordered catalog/bundle/receipt replay into a cold owner, including
fail-closed reads before the active publication and recovery after reopen.
Promoted-primary public-route and broader fault coverage remain separate gates.

The native policy boundary must be catalog-versioned authority, not a SQL
projection filter. A policy record needs the bound table ID/schema epoch,
command and role scope, USING/WITH CHECK expressions, setting dependency
identities, and a publication generation. Every protected read owner must
receive an authenticated principal and immutable policy/setting view, apply
USING before pagination, and return an owner proof tied to the same read cut.
Mutation preparation must check the old image for UPDATE/DELETE visibility and
the normalized new image for INSERT/UPDATE WITH CHECK inside the guarded commit;
API, pgwire, Lite, remote reads, and non-SQL mutation routes must not be able to
select an unprotected backend. A missing/stale policy view or unsupported owner
must deny the operation. Policy DDL must publish durably before it can authorize
new traffic, and prepared statements must revalidate policy and setting
generations. Until every public route and revocation/failover/restore test is
complete, active policy publication remains guarded by capability checks.

Ordinary document reads obtain the principal-independent policy publication
stamp using authenticated internal-service identity, without requiring separate
publication credentials merely to prove that no policy is active. The client
and metadata server share the read-grant classification. Status reads still
reject absent or invalid service tokens in migration mode; policy snapshots,
installation, work discovery and mutations retain their stronger grants.
An active serving stamp still requires an authenticated principal and an
owner-verified policy proof. Missing credentials never substitute for an
absent policy, and missing publication credentials disable background polling
rather than repeatedly issuing unauthorized requests.

### MERGE mutation lowering: partial

The reference branch admits matched UPDATE/DELETE, NOT MATCHED INSERT,
ordered conditional arms, DO NOTHING, expressions, RETURNING, and CTE sources.
The compiler now owns a bounded MERGE AST (source relation, join condition,
ordered conditional arms, structured expressions and RETURNING). It rejects
invalid matched/action pairs, duplicate assignments, and mismatched INSERT arity.
Explicit MERGE DEFAULT cells are omitted from the candidate image so the
pinned native schema applies defaults during preparation. The candidate binder pins the
authorized target once, binds a source-preserving target/source join, retains version/digest
metadata, and projects only referenced source fields (and only needed target
fields for delete-only plans). It binds typed arm predicates and values, infers
their parameters, and selects the first eligible arm lazily under three-valued
SQL logic. The bounded capture classifier rejects duplicate source actions on
one target before any image preparation. A batch builder prepares
fenced UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT images, generated row IDs, document preimages,
typed JSON-null metadata, and retained-byte limits before native admission.
Classification now resets one row-local predicate arena between candidates;
the selected arm ordinal is the only retained result. An opt-in 10,000-row
`ANTFLY_SQL_MERGE_CLASSIFY_BENCHMARK=1` comparison measured 3.92–4.23 ms with
arena reuse versus 4.24–4.69 ms with one arena per row across three local runs;
both retained 240,048 bytes in the benchmark's parent arena. This is a
classifier microbenchmark, not an end-to-end MERGE throughput claim.
MERGE executes only through a backend that stages the coordinated
target/source range proofs with the mutation in one durable transaction. The
API uses an implicit serializable transaction for autocommit MERGE and the same
proof path in an explicit stronger-isolation session. Read-committed or plain
batch backends reject before opening the candidate read. Unknown decisions
retain a reconciliation ID and are never replayed automatically.
RETURNING binds target and source expressions against the same candidate
capture, prepares native postimages before publication, then projects the
normalized target values alongside unchanged source values. A dedicated
prepared-image commit path stages those exact values without normalizing them
again. Projection errors
abort before commit; a missing native preparation capability fails closed.
Only referenced target fields are projected for DELETE/INSERT RETURNING, while
relational UPDATE retains its complete rewrite image.

Small `target._id = source.key` sources now use a 129-row decision capture followed
by deduplicated primary-key point scans (up to 64 keys per native capture).
Every source and target observation joins the same serializable transaction
read set, including misses; a source with more than 128 rows falls back to the
source-preserving hash join. The decision capture stops as soon as the source
is too large for point probes, rather than materializing it before the fallback
reads it again. The optimized source projection reuses the first binding's
authorized table identities, avoiding a second catalog resolve or a different
schema observation within the same statement. The point path never scans target-only rows and
retains the same ordered-arm and mutation-image builder. The mounted API test
asserts a source-only merge opens one point scan and no full target scan.
The original inventory's 14 non-recursive, non-mutation-producing MERGE SQL
cases now have exact-text compiler and authorized candidate-binder coverage;
the first cross-table case also executes a matched update and source-only
insert through one atomic mutation capture. Its mounted API adapter test now
retains source and target range guards on distinct owner routes in the same
committed transaction under an owned read/write identity, rejects missing
source read authority before opening a scan, and maps a source-side conflict
and an ambiguous commit outcome without automatic replay. A lost source proof
aborts before commit admission. These are adapter
fault fixtures. The original `sql-0579` text also passes through the mounted
`/db/v1/sql` handler with two affected rows; HTTP conflict and ambiguous-outcome
responses preserve their distinct retry guidance, with a reconciliation receipt
on the ambiguous outcome. The durable transaction/savepoint round-trip also
retains a read-only source participant's distinct owner route and exact range
generation after target writes are rolled back. HTTP prepare/execute now admits
MERGE; its durable prepared manifest pins both source and target identities and
the original case executes successfully from that resource. This is not yet real
cross-owner failover parity.
The exact `sql-0585` corpus statement also executes through `/db/v1/sql`,
verifying lower/upper source expressions in matched-update and source-only
insert images within one guarded commit.
The exact `sql-0581` statement exercises matched and source-only conditional
arms through that endpoint, including an all-false execution that commits a
guarded read decision with zero writes.
The exact `sql-0584` statement also returns the matched row's postimage and
computed lower-case status from the mounted endpoint with one guarded commit.

Remaining: data-modifying CTE producers require an explicit single-statement
dataflow/commit model; read-only CTE mutation sources are admitted. The bounded direct full-key index probe now
uses a catalog-pinned index identity, native require-index equality scans,
exact span proofs for misses and matches, source-key deduplication and a
16-row nonunique fanout cap. Sources above 32 rows, saturated fanout, and
non-READY indexes use the one-pass coordinated join. This is a conservative
crossover heuristic, not yet a measured adaptive cost model. Conjunctions of
typed equalities may bind every key of a composite total index in physical
index order; partial and expression ON keys still use the full join. Native `auto_index`
alone cannot provide the probe's serializable guarantee: it may choose a
primary scan when the index is not READY. Native
explicit-index reads fail closed on non-READY state and now capture an exact
index-span proof for full-key equality; prefix/range scans retain all 257
conservative primary buckets. The bounded distributed probe planner consumes
this narrower proof for serializable MERGE.
The native proof must be a tagged index-span observation pinned to the READY
index generation and its encoded equality prefix, not a reused primary bucket.
Prepare must reserve writer keys for both prior and candidate tuple prefixes
before admitting a primary intent; the final forward/reverse index effects
must increment the same span counters atomically with the primary row. A read
captures the span counter and matching entries from one retained snapshot,
including an empty result. Commit validation must check the counter and any
in-flight writer reservation. Composite prefixes and partial-index membership
changes need the same old/new reservation rule. Merely incrementing a counter
when staged index effects are sealed would leave a prepare-to-commit phantom
window; merely comparing a counter would miss pending writers. The distributed
proof wire, savepoint merge, and owner-routed prepare must carry the index
generation/span identity and fail closed on non-READY or changed generations.
The write-side foundation now derives a durable exact-tuple span identity from
each forward-index key and increments its counter in the same DocStore mutation
as the index entry. Native LSM reopen and overflow tests cover persistence and
atomic failure. An unchanged index tuple still advances its span generation
when the authoritative primary row is updated; eliding the forward-key rewrite
must not elide a serializable reader's conflict. The transaction manager now
accepts explicit old/new tuple
reservations, fences index-span counter predicates against pending writers, and
checks ordinary staged forward-index effects against active readers before
publication. The DB prepare path derives old tuples from reverse companions
(including retired generations) and new tuples from canonical AROW under the
pinned index plan, deduplicating reservations before intent admission. READY
publication now waits for unresolved row intents to drain, without making idle
read-only sessions block index readiness. Reservation gathering is capped by
the transaction read-guard budget even with retired-generation churn, and its
typed tuple-key batch reuses one row's buffers across the prepared write set.
The native reader now captures one tagged, exact-tuple proof for a full-key
inclusive equality (including a miss) from the same retained snapshot as its
rows. Other index scans keep the conservative primary-range proof. The
distributed proof transport and savepoint merge retain index identity and
reject changed generations; owner prepare checks the exact counter, pending
writers, current catalog head, READY progress, and maintenance control.
Cross-owner/failover fault coverage remains for the new probe planner.
The SQL scan contract now admits an explicit full-key index equality only
inside a coordinated statement read. Its owner adapter rejects absent or
conservative proofs instead of silently switching access paths. The immutable
SQL schema cache exposes direct total index candidates; partial and expression
indexes remain ineligible until their implication and expression proofs are
bound. The coordinated multi-owner read set now retains mutation digests and
document preimages across its bounded page copies; losing either would defeat
MERGE's native version fence. The planner selects this path only for bounded
sources and a complete direct total-index equality; otherwise it retains the
coordinated full join.
An empty implicit or explicit transaction does not force the index probe into
the session's primary-order overlay; once the session has staged table state,
the planner retains the coordinated full join for secondary-index matches.
Primary-key point reads remain available through the staged-session overlay.
The SQL regression exercises duplicate-source cardinality, a saturated
nonunique probe, non-READY fallback, composite-key order, rejection of an
incomplete composite predicate, and the 32-row source crossover without
committing a truncated candidate set. Native storage also checks that a
compound-key miss conflicts with a concurrent matching insert.
A native LSM microbenchmark rejected a tempting sorted multi-get substitution
for the current 257 primary-bucket proofs. Across 64 full-range captures,
scalar gets took about 8.2 ms versus 12.8 ms batched with sparse counters,
and 18.3 ms versus 23.6 ms with all counters populated. The scalar path stays
in place; reducing proof cardinality and conflict granularity is the needed
architectural win, not wrapping the same 257 keys in a batch call.
Acceptance requires duplicate-match, NULL-ON, ordered-arm, conflict,
concurrent-insert, cancellation/unknown-outcome, and cross-owner fault tests.
Most source corpus MERGE cases remain unresolved pending case-by-case endpoint
and distributed-fault evidence. Exact `sql-0579`, `sql-0581`, `sql-0584`, and
`sql-0585` have mounted success, source-conflict and unknown-outcome tests;
the latter two cases return a reconciliation ID rather than replaying.
Exact `sql-0582` also commits a
version-and-digest-fenced matched DELETE with both source and target proofs.
Exact `sql-0583` and `sql-0589` retain both range proofs in one committed
serializable decision when their ordered DO NOTHING arms emit no writes.
Exact `sql-0590` returns the normalized source-only INSERT postimage from
mounted SQL and retains the same two-range guarded commit, source-conflict and
ambiguous-outcome contracts.
Exact `sql-0587` and `sql-0588` execute expression and grouped OR/NOT arm
predicates on matched and source-only rows through that same guarded path.
The read-only CTE source in exact `sql-0623` also executes through mounted SQL,
retaining its archived-source proof and target proof with the matched update;
its durable prepared resource pins both table identities and rejects a replaced
archived source before capture. Missing source read authority also fails before
capture. This does not admit data-modifying CTE producers.

### TRUNCATE generation retirement: hosted public activation verified

The empty-generation implementation reuses durable restore staging: reserve fresh
table/range identities, prove each new owner has no primary, document-artifact,
identity, integrity-claim or ordered-index records, validate the empty cohort,
fence and drain old owners, and publish the replacement metadata atomically.
It does not copy, export or scan the old table's rows. Admission and resumed
workers require current whole-table administrator authority; row-filtered
credentials cannot authorize truncation. Success requires known publication,
not merely acceptance of the background job.

The original hosted activation required Raft-bound generation-handoff receipt
authority. Native standalone owners now provide a distinct durable native
seal/install protocol, with linked external-FK/graph restart coverage. Admission
still requires an explicit owner identity capability
for every selected source and untouched FK parent; missing/unsupported capability
returns unsupported before a durable job is created. Recovered plans check
hidden destinations, sources and untouched parents while still validating;
an unsupported pre-cutover attempt follows durable cancellation, leaving old
rows and identities intact. A capability mismatch after irreversible cutover
is a distinct recovery error and must retain fences, not authorize cancellation.
Native admission/recovery regressions pass: unsupported pre-cutover jobs reach
terminal cancellation without changing old rows, timestamps or identities.
Hidden target capabilities use a closed, service-authenticated control read,
bound to the exact plan, scope, namespace and empty-generation bootstrap, with
a fresh read-index barrier. The multi-range regression ensures exact-group
control reads use an empty key rather than a nonempty range start. This does
not relax public table routing or authorize providers without receipt authority.

RESTART IDENTITY uses that fresh owner generation. The SQL catalog currently
has no owned sequence or serial declaration, and generated row IDs are secure
opaque values, so no sequence counter exists to reset. Once owned sequences
are introduced, their new counter generation must be part of the same staging
plan and publication transaction.

Graph-index TRUNCATE has an owner-verified cutover protocol. Its scoped public
guard and test-only admission permit have been removed, and the rebuilt installed
CI binary has passed the strict-public baseline and fault cases. The old owner
closes graph reader, mutation,
maintenance, and worker-snapshot admission under its catalog/apply locks,
drains schedule pins, and persists a Raft-bound seal whose digest includes the
active source fence, old owner identity, locally verified graph configuration,
fresh generation, and staging-plan digest. The gate is reconstructed from
durable intent before optional graph runtimes start. The coordinator resolves
an uncertain seal reply by read-indexing the owner receipt; metadata requires
that exact digest for every old range before atomic publication. Graph plans
use only the new semantic configuration digest, not legacy raw-JSON matching.
Metadata treats graph `begin_cutover` as irreversible, so a late cancellation
cannot move a sealed owner into an unreopenable cancel phase; pre-cutover
cancellation remains available.

Focused tests cover graph read/apply pinning, worker pin drain, direct graph
write and maintenance rejection, lost seal reply, forged/missing Raft markers
and metadata receipts, duplicate seal replay, late cancellation, and a closed
gate after both pre-seal and post-seal restarts. Mounted public SQL tests require
202 admission without an override, an exact old-owner seal receipt before
publication, a fresh table/index with the old document absent, and cold data
restart. A mounted dependency-closed parent/child CASCADE
cutover now also passes: both new owners expose their Plan-bound durable handoff
receipts via read-indexed public routing before and after a cold data-owner
restart, and old parent/child rows remain absent. Both the baseline and
lost-seal/cold-owner recovery cases pass through the unguarded public route.

Planning and preflight now read a transactional authenticated retirement-set
summary instead of scanning historical tombstones. A compressed binary Patricia
tree binds immutable generation authority; activation, imported handoff records,
and tombstone GC update it in the same transaction as the affected records and
applied marker. Native checkpoints retain both, semantic HA replay reconstructs
both, and portable mapped restore does not import either old-generation authority.
Ordinary batches and prepared transactions cannot edit summary keys. A missing
root is accepted only after one bounded seek proves there are no tombstones;
there is no legacy scan fallback. Live admission scopes remain bounded and
deadline/cancellation checked. Seal retries read only the durable fence, intent,
and seal receipt. GC and handoff page admission conservatively charge the maximum
compressed-path write cost, even where a transaction can coalesce shared nodes.

`antfly-retirement-summary-test` passes 18 tests with no skips or leaks, including
abort/reopen, idempotent owner transfer, missing-root refusal, two-phase GC,
canonical insertion order, branch collapse, snapshot copy and worst-prefix depth.
The native Debug WAL benchmark makes the cost explicit: 64 single-record commits
use 130,124 insert bytes versus 56,000 without the tree (2.32x), and 73,075 GC bytes
versus 7,104 (10.29x). At 512 records in batches of 64, insertion is 741,238 versus
437,920 bytes (1.69x), and GC is 272,162 versus 46,752 (5.82x). Ten thousand summary
point reads took 14.27–16.53 ms locally. This is a bounded-read/progress tradeoff,
not a write-amplification improvement or a general latency guarantee.

The new mounted fault fixtures additionally pause after real parent activation,
parent ACK, or graph seal and cold-reopen the data owners before replaying the
original job. The graph fixture now requires a real public-write edge to be
visible before truncation and reuses both endpoint keys after restart to expose
stale adjacency. The installed `antfly-hosted-truncate-fk-recovery` CI binary
passes 16/16 tests with no skips or leaks: five real mounted workloads, two
focused unit regressions and nine import anchors. The strict-public workloads
include external-parent DROP (28.55 s), TRUNCATE baseline (31.96 s) and fault
recovery (28.62 s), and graph baseline/CASCADE (34.86 s) and fault recovery
(6.69 s), after the scoped capability routing fix. The relational API unit
target also passes 69/69, including both CASCADE admission cases and refusal
of missing parent admission proof or native receipt authority before durable
admission. Earlier permit-based cached repetitions passed
12/12; these are additional soak evidence, not substituted for the installed
strict-public run. The installed strict-public binary also passed three further
repetitions of all four TRUNCATE baseline/fault cases (12/12, no skips or leaks).
Timings are local Debug observations, not latency guarantees.
A separate prebuilt `fk-truncate` CI recovery lane selects these tests with the
existing hard watchdog and retained logs; it does not build native code on the
recovery runner or extend the initial-FK/self-FK lanes.

Incoming-FK CASCADE selection must never truncate an outgoing parent implicitly.
The current implementation includes untouched external parents in the fenced
retirement protocol without replacing their table generations, with mounted
strict-public baseline and fault validation. Untouched parents
retain inverse references containing the old child's constraint generation.
Ignoring a missing generation in the SQL/API
coordinator would be unsafe because native RESTRICT checks, participant commit
validation and referential-action cursors also consume those references.

Existing constraint retirement is correct but row-oriented: it scans children
and joins individual reference detaches to ordinary 2PC. The legacy retirement
worker still admits non-FK generations, including UNIQUE,
with durable page/restart proofs. It deliberately rejects an FK-removing target
at admission: its ready checkpoint does not carry the parent-owner ACK and
generation fence required to publish a changed child FK schema. FK retirement
must use the coordinated publication protocol rather than treating a drained
child claim as that missing cross-owner proof. The generation-level path avoids
copying parent data through this shared lifecycle:

1. Pin and reserve untouched parent definitions/ranges and exact old child FK
   generations in the staging plan. Fence and drain affected parent owners as
   well as old child owners; no schema or ownership change may invalidate this
   participant set.
2. Durably stage generation-specific inverse-reference tombstones on those
   parent owners. Pending tombstones must not change reference visibility.
3. Obtain the irreversible metadata activation decision, then activate only
   the corresponding accepted-generation scopes while retaining parent write
   fences. Publish the new child generation only after the required activation
   receipts are durable; a metadata-authorized parent ACK after publication
   releases those fences. Cancellation may remove pending state before the
   irreversible decision, not merely at any time before publication. Once that
   decision is durable, recovery must complete activation, publication and ACK.
4. Apply the same generation interpretation to native prepare and commit
   validation, RESTRICT/NO ACTION, witness checks, action cursors, and attach
   admission. Old-generation attachments remain forbidden. Existing prepared
   transactions must drain before activation, not be bypassed afterward.
5. Reclaim obsolete reference records with resumable bounded GC. Current
   reference keys hash the child generation with row identity, so they cannot
   be dropped using one generation-prefix delete. Foreground skipping must
   retain explicit work/cancellation budgets and cannot silently truncate a
   live-reference search.

The owner-local pending record for step 2 is checksummed and binds an exact
topology fence, plan digest, child table, and old/successor FK generations.
Restore plans pin untouched external parents and require durable parent fence
receipts before child cutover. The owner re-fetches an irreversible metadata
activation decision before committing a replicated accepted-generation scope;
range handoff carries that scope, and bounded resumable GC skips retired
references. The SQL child-only external-parent TRUNCATE route is publicly active
and verified by the installed recovery binary.
The parent activation step now retains its owner fence across restart, and
generic release/cancel cannot lift it; only a metadata-authorized ACK after
child publication releases admission. This closes the pre-publication orphan
window. The mounted fault fixture has passed cold-owner recovery after actual
activation and ACK, with the original job resumed rather than SQL resubmitted;
the installed strict-public run confirms this without an admission permit.
Ordinary FK schema edits now have a metadata-owned parent/source publication
and ACK protocol, while FK-bearing initial CREATE uses hidden child owners and
publishes the table only after parent and child receipts. Standalone initial
self-referential FK CREATE now uses authenticated native hidden-child owner
receipts and an atomic local catalog publication; a two-range restart fixture
and public valid/orphan-write fixture cover this path. The ordinary FK
publication supervisor selects nonterminal work through a durable fixed-width
active index instead of parsing historical publications on every tick; the
index and phase transition share one metadata transaction and snapshot.
Standalone initial FK
CREATE with external parents and initial MATCH PARTIAL declarations remain
guarded until their owner or atomic support-index paths are proven. Hidden-owner
standby replay has a Raft-bound batch envelope, but seed/promotion fault
coverage remains a release gate.

Hosted external-parent FK DROP is routed from SQL DROP CONSTRAINT or the REST
schema update through that same publication plan: an old-to-null generation
transition fences and drains child owners, obtains staged/activated/ACKed
parent-owner receipts, publishes the child schema at metadata, then installs it
with an exact Raft-bound source receipt. A focused state-machine test covers
DROP ordering across serialized restart. A mounted public SQL ADD/DROP workload
has passed parent-ACK-before-child-publication, valid child insert and blocked
parent delete before DROP, terminal DROP, cold owner restart, and permitted
parent delete afterward. A later repetition stalled on the pre-DROP parent
DELETE at Raft target index 10/applied 9; repeated stable completion remains a
release gate. The native parent-action lookup filters retired
inverse references before planning while scanning only a bounded physical
page; an empty retired-only page still advances its continuation to later live
references. GC currently scans routing-first reference keys, including live
records; high-churn retirement needs a bounded-scale proof or an atomically
maintained generation locator covering attach/detach, GC, restore, and range
handoff. `GenerationRetired` remains a typed pre-decision conflict rather
than poisoning Raft apply. The post-publication generation-GC poll uses a
cursor-capable snapshot read; a point-probe transaction previously returned
`Unsupported` before any GC page could be prepared. A byte-equal child index
catalog is not a valid publication invariant because a schema-version bump stages
`full_text_index_vN`; the plan re-derives the exact successor catalog using the
candidate's fresh index incarnation and rejects unrelated index edits. A
subsequent mounted DROP rerun stalled with a data-Raft apply index one behind
the requested index during pre-DROP parent DELETE; that intermittent failure
is still under exact-entry investigation, so the first pass is not soak proof.
The pure index validator currently lives in `api/tables.zig` and is called by metadata
plan validation; moving the shared index-derivation helpers to a
metadata-neutral schema module remains layering cleanup.
Distributed ordinary self-referential FK ADD/DROP is enabled through the
public SQL API. A plan binds each dual-role child/parent owner once and retains
one Raft-persisted fence through parent stage, activation and ACK. The child
schema, integrity catalog, accepted generation, Raft marker and fence release
are installed atomically after metadata publication. The public contract
remains 202 while this durable publication is pending. The standalone native
owner now supports ordinary FK generation publication and retirement through
the same durable owner metadata controls; focused native regression covers its
activation and replay. This is not a claim of mounted standalone fault soak.

Mounted regressions cover ADD enforcement, rejected parent deletion, DROP
retirement and allowed deletion, cold owner restart, lost owner/metadata
replies at each phase, simultaneous metadata and owner cold restart at parent
ACK, and three-voter owner leadership transfer during ADD and DROP. The
three-voter DROP initially stalled at parent stage because schema-migration
finalization cleared the old read layout and retired its versioned full-text
index after the immutable DROP plan was admitted. Metadata FK table locks now
distinguish generation publication from initial-FK support reservations:
only the latter may finalize its exact schema migration under lock. The
generation command requires an all-voter/learner v19 decoder proof both before
admission and at final Raft append, including a stale-term/membership check.
The corrected three-voter mounted test passes through both ADD and DROP ACK.

Focused storage regressions cover old-transaction drain, duplicate Raft
entries, active dual-role fence and parent ACK across cold reopen, atomic child
install, and standby replay, restart, handoff and promotion. Public writes
refresh an authoritative relational catalog and replan on a proven prepared
generation change; document-table cached writes retain their fast path.
Pre-decision `IntegrityTopologyBusy` is a retryable 409, while ambiguous
writes are never replayed. CI includes the mounted self-FK recovery binaries
so the full activation matrix continues to exercise these paths.

Initial MATCH PARTIAL support-index installation now reserves the parent
descriptor, hidden child identity, locks, and durable work in one metadata
transaction. The hosted path now seals parent support, places a private child
group, and admits a local Raft leader from a paired public/private metadata
cut. Hidden-child topology proposals now carry an exact private compiled-owner
descriptor through Raft instead of resolving an unpublished public table, and
skip the public dense-repair admission probe only for that no-document-write
control. Public CREATE now requires and returns 202 in the mounted fixture,
reaches `published` with durable child provision/release and parent
stage/activate/ACK receipts, and survives a data-owner restart. MATCH PARTIAL
valid inserts, orphan rejection, parent-delete protection, and restart reads
pass. Separate mounted tests pass lost owner/metadata replies at each driven
transition, cold restart of both metadata and data before child release, and
three-voter hidden-child leadership transfer before release with all physical
roots enrolled. The initial-CREATE public guard is removed. The linked metadata
facade now exposes the exact initial group reservation; native boundary and
concrete service/facade capability tests prevent silently emitting ordinary
placement commands for reserved hidden owners.
Standalone cancellation has an exact hidden-owner retirement path and a
checksummed local intent. Its self-FK two-range crash/restart and terminal
cold-root tests pass. Hosted retirement now uses the distinct metadata-owned
authority and offline-store machinery below, including mounted offline-rejoin
fault validation.

#### Hosted retirement activation update

Metadata retains a plan-wide-bounded history of every admitted hidden replica,
including placements removed before cancellation.
Publication retains obsolete replicas for cleanup while excluding current
physical group/node/store slots. Tickets distinguish canceled plans from
published-obsolete roots; neither authorizes unlinking a current published
owner. Paging and ACK recheck the immutable plan and current placement in one
metadata transaction. Re-admission to a retired physical slot waits for its
unlink ACK even when replica labels or root generations change.

Authority is explicit administrator enrollment, not ordinary service
registration. OpenAPI routes and generated clients expose
`POST /store-roots/enroll` and read-only
`POST /store-roots/enrollment-status`. The CLI produces an existing root's
signed proof, submits it, and queries its exact identity. Metadata persists
one immutable verifier for the node/store/root identity. Signed retirement
paging and ACKs bind the cluster, store, root, ticket, and request cut. Hosted
child provision/release receipts carry a root attestation checked against
enrollment, the immutable plan, and current placement. These initial-FK
contracts require protocol v19 on every metadata voter and learner; ordinary
mixed-version store registration retains its older encoding. See
[store-root enrollment](store-root-enrollment.md) for operational details.

The worker verifies an exact cold owner bootstrap and persists a checksummed
local intent before quiescing the owner, Raft, readers, writers, and snapshots.
It can cancel a private owner offline without quorum, rename only the verified
root to trash, fsync, remove only the matching local replica catalog entry, and
retry a signed ACK after restart. Prepared/unlinked intents protect replacement
roots across crashes. Permanent generation fences prevent stale rejoin.
Trash GC is separate from acknowledgement: inode-bound, no-follow traversal
persists its cursor and limits entries, deletes, depth, and elapsed time per
slice. Tests exercise real fsynced files and cold-proof callbacks, with a
separate native LSM cold-cancel/reopen test. The mounted three-node canceled
CREATE test also passes: a provisioned follower goes offline and loses its
placement, the coordinator terminally cancels with injected lost replies, and
the same physical root returns. The real signed-page worker cold-cancels and
unlinks that exact root, signs an ACK, and retains its resurrection fence;
the existing public parent survives and the canceled child stays invisible.
The passing mounted matrix comprises
`antfly-api-hosted-initial-fk-test`,
`antfly-api-hosted-initial-fk-fault-test`,
`antfly-api-hosted-initial-fk-transfer-test`, and both retirement cases in
`antfly-api-hosted-initial-fk-offline-test`. The published-obsolete case removes
an offline follower after its release but before metadata publication, then
rejoins that same root while draining. Its distinct signed ticket retires the
released obsolete root without cancellation; the surviving current child
owner remains released and public, with no retirement ticket. Both offline
cases verify actual root disappearance, acknowledged discovery removal, and
the permanent exact-generation resurrection fence.
PR and main E2E gates build the initial and ordinary/self-FK proof binaries
once with the shared native archives, then run them in two separate recovery
lanes. Each prebuilt binary has a 15-minute hard timeout and retained logs;
recovery runners do not rebuild native code, and these fixtures are not added
to the unit-test aggregate.

Raft membership admission uses the exact native applied/pending/retained
configuration cut. An unapplied merge acquire fences membership; an unapplied
release cannot unfence it, and a retained-log gap fails closed. Forwarded,
batched, and automatic joint-consensus exit proposals share this admission
callback instead of relying only on the administrative HTTP route.

The UUID and Ed25519 seed identify a root lineage, not unique hardware. Native
shard backups and default standby seed capture exclude the outer identity.
An operator's full-root copy can clone that identity and key; enrollment is
not hardware attestation or cloned-disk detection. Replacement roots require
explicit enrollment and placement approval, not trust-on-first-use. Public
initial-CREATE activation has mounted publication, restart, hidden-owner
failover, and canceled-offline retirement evidence, not retirement unit tests
alone.

Acceptance needs crash/lost-ack tests at each fence, publication and activation
boundary, cancellation on both sides of publication, parent mutations and new
child inserts during cutover, stale prepared participants, nullable/MATCH PARTIAL
witnesses, and GC/restart bounds. No disconnected tombstone contract or
coordinator-only filter constitutes completion of this boundary.

### Distributed online merge: ordered artifact authority

Online merge admission now carries an ordered artifact catalog in the same
data-Raft command as donor admission or the receiver's initial acceptance. There
is no separate, unfenced catalog-seal window. Metadata pins immutable exact
bindings for both owners; native apply validates namespace, prior catalog epoch,
source/receiver scope, integrity catalog and topology before it can reconcile
local materialization. Data protocol v14 and metadata protocol v20 now gate the
complete ordered artifact decoder, including typed-vector transfer, before even
an empty first page is admitted. Eligible document owners automatically support
row-derived fulltext and direct-field dense/sparse indexes. Graph, generated
vectors, enrichment and resolver tails remain explicitly ineligible.

All ordered eligible owners capture document-owned base embeddings, including
historical values without an active index and fulltext-only tables. Snapshot
objects preserve exact base-artifact bytes; checksum-bound, restartable chunks
carry large dense/sparse values. Retained vector effects and their Raft marker
commit together; prepared transactions reserve artifact bytes before commit.
Receiver application records both positive and deleted vector effects in the
derived replay journal, so coverage and projection readiness share the durable
commit. Direct-field repair reads primary rows and same-snapshot artifact
fallbacks, excluding artifacts whose document no longer exists.

Sparse replacement preserves stable document ordinals using monotone
incarnations and point-addressable immutable posting/docmap sidecars. Queries
filter stale postings before score accumulation; compaction carries captured
incarnations and safely tolerates later updates. Legacy segments remain
readable. Query caches are bounded, and compaction reserves its source,
incarnation and output working set before cloning source data. Native checkpoint
capture also waits for in-flight immutable flush publication before certifying
the source cut.

Each binding includes an exact physical catalog digest and a separate canonical
logical-definition digest. Cross-owner compatibility ignores insertion order,
absent versus serialized-empty catalogs, JSON object key order and owner-local
coverage generations. Configuration differences still reject admission. Each
owner retains its own exact ordered generation, so a healthy receiver does not
rebuild its indexes merely because the donor has independently assigned
generations. The source/page identity and durable source receipt include both
digests; command validation recomputes the logical proof from the actual catalog.

Replica-local drift does not determine the replicated state-machine decision.
After semantic preflight, native apply persists an exact reconciliation intent
and retries bounded work until the intended catalog is physically ready. The
intent fences unrelated schema, artifact, topology and row-policy publication;
explicit private reconciliation contexts permit only monotonic changes toward
that exact intent. Fulltext materialization uses the existing managed shadow
generation scheduler. Obsolete resolver artifacts use a durable, restartable
128-key cleanup cursor, with producer publication fenced against writes behind
the cursor. Final admission, ordered authority, applied receipt and intent/cursor
removal commit atomically. Failed or repair-unavailable indexes and outstanding
retired-artifact cleanup cannot certify readiness.

Native same-owner snapshots preserve pending reconciliation. Portable export,
backup capture and restore publication reject a pending intent rather than
export a partially reconciled catalog; a new namespace cannot inherit another
owner's ordered authority. Catalog-preview changes before cutover durably cancel
the metadata attempt instead of retrying an obsolete preview indefinitely.

Focused regressions cover stale-command rejection before mutation, invalid
source preflight, explicit-context and low-level catalog mutation rejection,
standby replay, populated fulltext repair, restart during multi-page resolver
cleanup, late producer rejection, backup/restore fences, semantic compatibility
and forged proofs. The mounted three-metadata/three-data-node regression
`test_online_merge_recovers_after_owner_link_outage_and_crash[accept-accept_reply_restart]`
passed against a freshly built Debug CLI. It verifies default online selection
with the normal fulltext index, both immutable artifact bindings, loss of a
successful ordered receiver-accept reply, responder restart, an exact idempotent
retry, and the durable source binding and initial page digest/head after
`begin_copy`. After ordinary completion and source release, all original rows
(including a 2 MiB document) remain publicly readable and the copied fulltext
document appears exactly once. The test uses transport faults, not forced
unfencing. This is one mounted fault case, not a repeated full fault matrix.
Public table metadata assigns a shared index incarnation across ordinary shards;
independent-generation compatibility and a crash during active reconciliation
are native regression cases, not artificially injected mounted catalog drift.

The direct-vector native suite passes 15 tests. Five additional cached receiver
soaks passed (65 tests total), including full-index and default-sync projection
scores, positive-tail journal membership, duplicate chunks, owner restart,
historical sparse values larger than 16 MiB, historical dense values exceeding
65,535 dimensions, and fulltext-only latent artifacts. Debug receiver timings
were 9.30–9.84 s (large/full-index), 5.06–5.43 s (default sync), and 2.27–2.44 s
(fulltext-only). These are correctness fixture timings, not throughput claims.
The sparse compatibility suite passed 23 tests, including legacy replacement,
late-update compaction, reopen, corruption and memory-denial cases. Dedicated
compaction/selective-query performance comparison remains unmeasured.

### Latest local validation

- Joined-mutation/recursion follow-up: 195 SQL tests pass in Debug and
  ReleaseSafe, including allocation failures, target ambiguity, DELETE fanout,
  CTE target shadowing, recursive cycle/null semantics and shared physical
  captures. With `ANTFLY_SQL_JOINED_MUTATION_BENCHMARK=1`, the 4,096-row
  ReleaseSafe joined UPDATE fixture reads 8,192 native rows in one capture,
  performs 32,797 checkpoints, peaks at 9,357,062 query bytes, and takes about
  19–22 ms locally with the production allocator and an explicit 64 MiB budget.
  This is executor work-count/allocation evidence, not distributed write latency.
  Pgwire passes 43 tests; the broader native SQL API run passes 159 tests and
  relational row/schema contracts pass 50 tests. The real staged-worker fault
  fixture passes for Raft and native empty-generation owners with lost replies
  and reopen after begin/validate/publication; targets remain empty, donors
  retain their old data, and no source import or tail is executed. The final
  native transaction suite passes all 101 tests in Debug with no leaks. The
  prepared HTTP/native rerun passes all five selected tests after correcting
  generated-router handler signatures; the full API fault-test build also
  verifies that router integration. Generation, formatting, OpenAPI checks and
  diff whitespace checks pass locally. These checks do not establish full
  repository or CI parity.
- Follow-up session and TRUNCATE checks: the pgwire suite passes 47 tests,
  including scoped `application_name` and complete-statement savepoint parsing.
  The three native TRUNCATE API tests pass, including RESTART IDENTITY admission
  with the current sequence-free catalog. The full graph and external-parent
  FK cutover remains guarded.
- Shape-aware subquery follow-up: 180 Debug and ReleaseSafe tests pass, including quantified
  comparison truth tables, computed correlation keys, composed aggregates,
  independently bound complete value relations, and physical cold-field pruning.
  The 10,000-row ReleaseSafe benchmark with the production allocator measured
  approximately 49 ms for membership (three scans, one capture, 8.43 MB query
  peak) and 26–27 ms for ordered ANY/EXISTS (two scans, one capture, 7.27 MB).
  These synthetic local measurements are not distributed latency claims and
  are not comparable to older timings using the leak-checking allocator.
  Routine tests retain leak detection; the opt-in workload uses the production
  allocator to avoid measuring debug allocation quarantine.
  A final 10,000-row rerun measured 57 ms membership, 30–31 ms ordered
  subqueries, and 20 ms uncorrelated EXISTS. The latter fetched 256 inner rows
  rather than all 10,000, with all 10,000 outer rows preserved; the native
  projection excludes discarded cold fields. These are separate workload
  shapes, not an apples-to-apples speedup comparison.
- Current integration checks: 154 SQL-filtered API tests, 50 public relational
  row/schema contracts, 30 pgwire tests, 382 TypeScript SDK tests (one skipped),
  157 Antfarm tests, 22 Python SQL tests and all Go SDK tests pass. Prepared
  resources have five focused HTTP/native tests and five Zig client tests.
  The final ReleaseSafe native run passes 98 transaction and 10 Lite SQL tests,
  including expression/partial arbitration, activation and retirement, with
  zero leaks. Ordinary column-only constraint fingerprints retain their fast
  path; typed layout/VM construction is lazy for expression/partial shapes.
  `make generate`, `make fmt` and the Zig OpenAPI freshness check pass.
- The original 1,586-case SQL extraction corpus now has a provenance-pinned inventory and
  exhaustive disposition ledger. `make sql-parity-inventory-check` verifies its
  integrity. `make sql-parity-release-check` intentionally blocks until each
  source case has executable evidence or a justified exclusion; creating the
  inventory alone is not parity completion. See [the inventory guide](sql-parity-inventory.md).
- Seven original TRUNCATE cases now have SQL-neutral IDs, explicit supersession
  rationale, exact-statement admission tests, and real empty-generation owner
  publication/restart evidence. `make sql-parity-evidence-check` runs referenced
  gates before the full corpus is resolved: the focused public API TRUNCATE
  suite passes eight tests without leaks and the staged-owner rewrite/empty-
  generation driver passes two. The remaining 1,381 case dispositions still
  block release.
  The graph-index guard now inspects only selected tables after FK closure,
  so an unrelated graph table neither blocks admission nor incurs index-JSON
  parsing; a graph-indexed CASCADE participant remains guarded. Unknown target
  names fail before the dependency walk parses unrelated table schemas.
- All 21 currently referenced `make sql-parity-evidence-check` gates pass,
  including partial evidence on unresolved original prepared CTE mutations;
  partial evidence does not grant release credit.
  The evidence runner combines compatible Zig test filters for the same target
  into seven build invocations, preserving all 21 gate identities and their
  bounded aggregate timeouts. The grouped run passed all selected tests in
  5m54s on this machine with a cold API test rebuild; this is not a controlled
  before/after speedup measurement.
  The current SQL suite passes 227 tests, including the VALUES-subquery and
  observed-group Top-K admission cases.
  The dry-run EXPLAIN and mutation-subquery follow-up passes exact mounted
  text/JSON cases and a write-permission denial test; its test backend
  rejects any accidental row scan or mutation. `make fmt-check` and the
  parity-checker unit suite also pass.
  The inventory validator now prevents a behavior-required original case from
  being marked `rejected`, or an original rejection from being marked
  `implemented` without a tested `superseded` disposition. This protects the
  release gate from status-only waivers; the 1,381 unresolved cases remain
  blocking, and these focused evidence gates do not prove full distributed
  or workload parity.
- The routed table-read suite passes 81 consumer tests, including an exact
  secondary-index proof across two owners and fail-closed cleanup when one
  owner cannot provide the proof, provides a different span identity, or
  returns a malformed proof tag. Its
  18 implementation tests also pass.
- Top-K replacement now reuses the displaced root's bounded arena. A local
  10,000-row/k=5 all-competitive churn test kept its 1,299-byte allocation
  peak and 44,987 comparisons while dropping Debug elapsed time from about
  766 ms to 8 ms; the ReleaseSafe run took about 0.85 ms. The full SQL suite
  passes 207 tests, including allocation-failure, quota and guarded MERGE
  compiler checks. Joined mutations reuse the once-authorized target schema
  when binding read relations; the shared resolver refuses write/admin calls
  and still resolves other physical sources with read authority.
- Pgwire accepts the negotiated UTF-8 `client_encoding` through connection-owned
  SET/LOCAL/SHOW/RESET and rejects non-UTF-8 changes. The exact original
  `sql-0778` statement has mounted simple/extended wire evidence; the pgwire
  suite passes 54 tests. Eight original cases are superseded, eight original
  invalid-shape cases have exact-SQL rejection evidence. The original
  `sql-0019` computed descending-order `LIMIT 5` query now has mounted HTTP
  execution evidence over seven native typed rows, including exact large-
  integer output. The exact `sql-0020`, `sql-1254`, and `sql-1255` grouped
  reads now have mounted native-backed HTTP evidence for expression grouping,
  output aliases in `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`, and mixed-case aggregate counts.
  Seven exact CTE aggregate/read cases now have mounted native-backed evidence,
  including null-safe JSON/status filters, missing values, CTE column aliases,
  chained filters, and ordered output. Four matching materialization-hint and
  classifier cases now have exact endpoint evidence plus repeated-reference
  work-count coverage. Eighteen exact scalar-subquery, existence and
  quantified/membership cases now have mounted endpoint evidence. Seven
  equality/ordered correlated cases also pass exact mounted output/cardinality
  checks. Ten exact quantified LIKE/ILIKE cases now have mounted endpoint,
  wildcard/NULL truth-table and quota evidence. Five OR-correlated EXISTS cases
  have exact mounted evidence plus nested/NULL/NOT EXISTS unit coverage. Nine
  compound, nested, and CTE-contained subquery cases also have exact mounted
  output evidence. Two exact no-op MERGE cases have guarded mounted-commit
  evidence. One exact matched-DELETE MERGE also has a guarded mounted-commit
  check. Four other exact MERGE cases additionally have case-specific source
  conflict and ambiguous-commit evidence. Source-only INSERT RETURNING has
  the same mounted proof and fault coverage. Expression and grouped predicate
  arms and a read-only CTE-backed MERGE have exact mounted coverage. A linked
  hosted CTE self-MERGE now prepares and executes the exact `sql-0008` body
  through authenticated HTTP, proving real Raft-owner statement-fence capture,
  guarded prepare/commit and row read-back. The linked hosted test also runs
  exact pgwire PREPARE/EXECUTE against that owner, verifies the `MERGE 1`
  completion and typed row, and distinguishes precommit read unavailability
  from an ambiguous write outcome. The same hosted fixture now mounts the exact
  `sql-0005` pgwire cross-table CTE INSERT and verifies `INSERT 0 1` plus typed
  target read-back. The exact `sql-0009` recursive prepared read emits three
  rows from a parent/child worklist, and `sql-0010` updates the two distinct
  targets through the same hosted owner path. Multi-owner and distributed fault
  evidence remain open;
  1,381 cases remain unresolved.

- Follow-up ReleaseSafe SQL suite: 168 tests. Membership benchmark (opt-in
  `ANTFLY_SQL_MEMBERSHIP_BENCHMARK=1`): 10,000 outer and 10,000 inner rows,
  three scans, one coordinated capture, 8.43 MB query peak, about 1.59 seconds.
  The routine fixture is smaller and still crosses multiple native pages. The
  OR-correlated EXISTS path on the same opt-in 10,000-row fixture used three
  scans, one capture, 20,256 native rows (the uncorrelated witness stops after
  its first 256-row page), and a 7.48 MB query peak; the local Debug run took
  about 120 ms with the production allocator. This is bounded by the branch
  count rather than outer-row count.
- Pgwire follow-up: 28 tests; native adapter: seven tests, including typed
  expression arguments, JSON-null provenance, cancellation and credential checks.
- Final SQL-filtered API integration: 31 tests, no leaks; `make generate` and
  `make fmt` passed after integration.
- Follow-up native storage: 92 tests; distributed transactions: 96; Lite SQL: 9.
  New fault tests cover reservation survival across two restarts, atomic counter
  exhaustion, and rejection of equal counters after restore/topology/identity
  changes. These are focused fault tests, not a complete distributed chaos gate.
- Native LSM bookkeeping workload (Debug, 100 batches of 32 common-prefix rows):
  tracking inactive 452 ms versus active 485 ms, about 7.3% overhead in one run.
  This is preliminary, not a statistically rigorous production throughput claim.
- Forward-cursor follow-up: pgwire suite passes 30 tests, including real
  BEGIN/DECLARE/FETCH FORWARD/FETCH ALL/COMMIT protocol lifecycle with bounded
  pages and a failed-fetch/transaction-abort path with retained-stream release;
  parser coverage includes quoted identifiers, FETCH ALL, CLOSE ALL, and
  rejected scroll/hold options. SQL-filtered API integration passes 31 tests
  with no leaks. These focused checks do not replace the full SQL extraction parity and
  distributed-fault gates.
- Partial unique `ON CONFLICT` follow-up: SQL runtime/compiler suite passes 170
  tests; distributed transaction suite passes 97 tests, including stronger
  predicate implication and rows entering/leaving partial-index membership;
  C API suite passes 23 tests. `make fmt` and `git diff --check` pass. This
  covers the bounded simple-predicate shape only, not expression/deferrable
  arbiters or the complete SQL extraction parity gate.

- Expanded SQL runtime/compiler/binder: 156 tests in ReleaseSafe; pgwire:
  25 tests; native SQL pgwire adapter and mounted route: seven tests. Final
  combined SQL-filtered API run: 30 tests; distributed transactions: 96 tests.
- API guarded-session integration covers activation, guard-only commit,
  savepoint observation retention, changed-proof rejection before row fetch,
  and DELETE RETURNING with row digest and range proof in one commit plan.
- DocStore/native transactions: 89 tests, including recovery and range-guard
  races. A 100,000-touch bookkeeping fixture performs one activation probe and
  zero counter writes when inactive, versus two probes and one coalesced counter
  write for an active single bucket. This is not a storage-throughput benchmark.
- Native Lite SQL: nine tests, including document mutation/preimage preservation,
  schema fences, same-TTL stale-write rejection, normalized RETURNING, composite
  arbiters, self-FK cascades and stale claim rejection.
- The synthetic 10,000-row pull fixture retains about 98 KiB; one ReleaseSafe
  run produced its first 73-row page in 0.42 ms and completed in 63 ms. This is
  an in-process executor/allocation measurement, not distributed throughput.
- Window tests cover peer-aware frames, grouping/HAVING phase ordering,
  cancellation, exhaustive allocation failures, all boundaries of filtered
  nullable moving frames, and intermediate-versus-result numeric overflow.
- The ReleaseSafe 10,000-row, 8,193-wide moving SUM fixture uses 2.73 MiB of
  indexed aggregate state and completes in about 2 ms. This measures the
  aggregate operator, excluding scan, binding and network work.
- `make generate` succeeded using `/private/tmp/antfly-sql-generate-cache` after
  the default cache again referenced a missing generator executable. `make fmt`
  succeeded across Zig, Go, Python, TypeScript and Rust.

### Prior checkpoint validation

- SQL runtime/compiler/binder: 122 tests; pgwire: 23 tests.
- Native RETURNING/Lite integration: four tests, including document reads.
- API SQL integration: 128 tests, including document snapshot isolation.
- Native relational/index suite: 122 tests, plus the focused ReleaseSafe
  document snapshot fixture; retained-read registry: three lifecycle tests.
- Linked retained-read owner tests passed, including the native read-provider
  integration target. Document SQL rejects the relational-only stateless
  fallback when a retained reader is unavailable.
- `make generate` succeeded with a separate cache after the default Zig cache
  reported missing generator artifacts; `make fmt` succeeded.
- Go SDK module: `go test ./...` passed, including generated SQL policy tests.
- ReleaseSafe nested-shape binding microbenchmark: roughly 5.24 microseconds
  and 31.4 KiB arena capacity for inferred input versus 2.83 microseconds and
  17 KiB with explicit hints. Both perform zero data reads. This measures
  binding overhead, not distributed query throughput.

## Architecture

One bounded lexical/semantic compilation produces an immutable, owned syntax
plan. Typed positional parameters bind without rewriting SQL. Binding resolves
only referenced catalog names and pins immutable physical identity and schema;
execution reuses the native read and atomic distributed mutation contracts.
Neither the historical mega-branch storage engine nor its old catalog is copied.

Page arenas are released between reads. Output and mutation admission limits are
independent from SQL LIMIT; exceeding a result cap must fail, not silently
truncate a query. Mutations prepare the entire bounded write set before making
one native atomic commit, with observed row versions and the bound schema epoch.
SQL cannot retry an ambiguous mutation automatically.

Allocation admission applies before allocation to both result arena capacity
and temporary page storage. Page-count limits also bound scans that return no
matches. Exact integer columns never round-trip through a floating-point JSON
representation. Native committed-but-pending/repair-required outcomes and
ambiguous transaction receipts must remain visible in SQL responses.

All public contracts originate in OpenAPI. Protocol-specific PostgreSQL OIDs
belong in pgwire, not the native durable types. Graph and lake SQL adapters remain
outside SQL extraction, as specified in the restructuring plan.

## Historical initial slice

- Shared bounded scanner and immutable, owned single-statement compiler;
  parameters are typed nodes rather than SQL substitution. See
  `zig/pkg/antfly/src/sql/COMPILER_SUPPORT.md` for exact grammar coverage.
- Shared non-executing Describe/Execute binder: one authorized catalog lookup,
  positional parameter inference, ordered column metadata, and owned typed JSON
  literals parsed once per binding. Conflicting parameter types fail early.
- Relational SELECT projections, conjunction predicates, COUNT, primary-key
  ordering, LIMIT/OFFSET; version-conditional INSERT with explicit `_id`,
  literal-assignment UPDATE, and DELETE through the native atomic coordinator.
- Exact `_id` predicates lower to native point-key spans, including shard-start
  boundaries. UPDATE reads only preserved columns, relies on the whole-row
  version fence, and shares immutable assignment values across prepared rows.
  SQL writes to generated columns are rejected; native generation remains the
  single owner of their values. NULL comparisons can eliminate scans without
  bypassing column validation or permissions.
- Current-catalog binding and authorization, schema fencing, projection and
  predicate pushdown, cancellation, preallocation memory admission, and bounded
  mutation preparation. Unsupported shapes fail before mutation.
- A shared, bounded, scope-partitioned immutable plan cache is used by both
  HTTP SQL and pgwire. It compiles outside its short publication mutex, deduplicates
  concurrent misses, and only evicts idle leased plans; schema resolution,
  authorization, binding and parameter values remain request-local.
- Schema derivation is cached independently in bounded immutable entries (32 MiB
  maximum, four concurrent builders). Hits reuse compact typed columns without
  reparsing schemas. Catalog identity and authorization are still resolved and
  fenced per request; the cache is not an authorization or routing cache.
- HTTP and pgwire share bounded preparation admission, followed by an owned
  read or write execution permit held through completion. HTTP overloads return
  SQLSTATE 53300 with retry guidance. Compiler positions survive worker dispatch.
- Native SQL scan requests stay typed from the executor to the local storage
  boundary. The relational reader can choose a READY compound or partial index
  for a leading equality prefix and intersected range suffix, retaining the complete predicate as a
  residual check; the primary-key path remains the deterministic fallback.
  Explicit primary-key ordering disables secondary-index selection. Candidate
  eligibility is checked before durable readiness I/O, and readiness checks
  reuse one ownership proof from the pinned transaction.
  A sixteen-candidate shortlist uses at most eight snapshot-local index records
  per candidate for costing; a sole candidate needs no cardinality probe.
  Descending bounds and binary versus folded collations preserve predicate
  semantics. These are bounded actual probes, not persistent cardinality stats.
  The schema, index plan and store transaction are pinned together; compilation,
  readiness reads and cardinality probes run after releasing the shared apply
  lock, so planning does not serialize writers behind its allocations or I/O.
- Native retained readers own the schema/store snapshot, compiled predicates,
  projections and row-level authorization filter. Their typed pages decode
  selected ordinals directly, preserving exact integers and missing/null values
  without serializing and reparsing row JSON. SQL cursors close on completion,
  early LIMIT, error or cancellation; mutation preparation releases the read
  snapshot before entering commit admission.
  Single-local-owner provisioned routing carries the original table/topology
  fence and retains owner/admission leases across pages through the checked
  native archive ABI. Leader loss never downgrades retained admission to stale.
  Catalog checks before and after opening tie the snapshot to its SQL binding;
  they are not repeated for every page. Pgwire rechecks credentials and read
  authorization on each retained page and normalizes deadlines to storage time.
- Generated `/sql` contracts plus Go, TypeScript, Python, and Zig convenience
  APIs. Mutation state and transaction receipts survive both success and error
  responses. The one-shot `antfly sql` command sends separately typed parameters
  and never automatically retries or follows redirects for SQL mutations.
- Standalone PostgreSQL protocol/listener module with authenticated backend
  callbacks, typed parameters, bounded prepared statements and portals, and
  structured `std.Io` cancellation. The native adapter reuses the shared binder,
  authentication/policy machinery and atomic coordinator. Prepared statements
  carry pre-execution identity/schema fences, and portals retain bounded native
  results without copying them again. The optional `pgwire` node configuration
  registers the listener with the production API kernel, enforces authenticated
  and protected transport configuration, and joins connections before teardown;
  see `zig/pkg/antfly/src/pgwire/README.md`.

### Initial read capability limit (superseded for coordinated local owners)

Native retained readers provide an owner-local statement snapshot, not a globally
repeatable cross-owner snapshot. The SQL adapter uses the retained-read capability
only when explicitly supplied by its read provider. For providers without it,
statements that would require a second native page fail with
`SqlStatementSnapshotRequired` before returning results or committing writes.
Retained-reader support must replace this gate before unrestricted SQL scans,
range mutations, cursors, or stronger SQL transaction guarantees are exposed.

## Original SQL extraction work list (see integration status above)

1. Extend retained reads beyond the implemented single-local-owner path with
   remote-owner handles and a coordinated cross-owner read fence. Preserve
   schema/table identity, topology, cancellation and bounded admission.
   Range/phantom protection must be explicit for transactional mutations.
   This requires owner-issued read handles and coordinator cleanup across
   success, timeout, disconnect, topology change and partial acquisition; the
   existing independent scan calls cannot supply a global snapshot. Carry the
   implemented typed pages through that protocol, encoding only at process
   boundaries. A durable owner-validated binding lease can eventually replace
   the current bounded schema cache plus pre/post-open catalog checks.
2. Binder-resolved scalar-expression IR and boolean predicates, ready-index
   selection/costing, bounded sort/top-K, aggregates/windows, joins, CTEs and
   subqueries. Reconcile each supported shape with the mega-branch parity corpus.
3. Document execution; native SQL primary-key policy; expression DML, conflict
   actions/RETURNING, and catalog/schema/index/constraint/tablespace SQL DDL.
   Parsing basic DDL does not mean it is executable today.
4. SQL sessions, transactions/savepoints, streaming cursors and native
   coordinator ownership. Sessions, transaction/savepoint state, retained
   readers, HTTP `session_id`, prepared identity fences and reauthorization are
   implemented for admitted native providers. Stronger-isolation deployment
   across every provider and its complete fault coverage remain unfinished.
5. Pgwire transaction status/session ownership; Lite/C ABI, interactive CLI and
   Antfarm SQL workbench. Production listener configuration and lifecycle are
   implemented, including explicit transactions on supported native owners.
   Bounded scroll/hold cursors are implemented; the full session-setting surface
   remains incomplete.
6. Full source parity and release gates, end-to-end fault/cancellation tests,
   workload benchmarks and observability. Update this ledger before publication.

## Validation gates

- Compiler syntax, ownership, parameter, limits, and hostile-input tests.
- Bound executor correctness, schema/version fences, null/numeric semantics,
  bounded scans, atomic mutations, cancellation, and allocation-failure tests.
- Authenticated HTTP execution and catalog authorization parity tests.
- Protocol simple/extended query, parameters, cancellation, and auth tests.
- SQL DDL, sessions, transactions, prepared statements, and cursors.
- Document execution, joins/aggregates/windows, and source parity corpus.
- Lite/C ABI, CLI/workbench, generated clients and freshness checks.
- Benchmarks distinguishing parse, bind, execution, and retained memory.

The focused tests in this slice do not satisfy the complete SQL extraction release gate.

### Verified initial slice

- SQL compiler/binder/executor: 41 tests; pgwire protocol: 20 tests.
- Native SQL/pgwire API integration: 45 tests, including timestamp precision,
  credential rotation, allocation failures, body limits, and generated columns.
- CLI: 87 tests; Zig SQL SDK: 4 tests, including no-replay behavior through both
  the generated and convenience clients with an unsafe borrowed retry policy.
- HTTP library: 584 passed, 8 skipped; OpenAPI generator: 75 tests.
- Go SDK suite passed; TypeScript SDK: 361 passed, 1 skipped, and typecheck;
  Python client/SQL tests: 72 passed.
- Zig OpenAPI and SQL grammar freshness checks passed; Python generated models
  are current. Repository formatting completed.

These are local focused checks, not a full release or CI run. The repository-wide
license check still reports pre-existing header mismatches outside this slice.

### Verified retained-read and planner follow-up

- SQL executor/compiler/binder: 49 tests; pgwire protocol/lifecycle: 21 tests.
- Relational storage/index suite: 112 tests, including typed projection parity,
  retained snapshot ownership/cancellation and planning outside the apply lock.
- API runtime: 17 tests; physical table reads: 18; linked read consumers: 75.
  These execute multi-page SQL, replacement during admission, credential
  revocation, strict leader-loss rejection and retained-owner cleanup.
- Actual hidden storage-owner ABI: one regression covers checked provider
  acquisition, typed paging, snapshot stability and translated errors.
- Configuration: 48 tests. Go SDK suite, Python SQL (12), TypeScript SQL (12)
  and TypeScript typechecking passed.
- Repository format checking and generated Zig OpenAPI freshness passed.

The default local Zig cache had missing generated artifacts; freshness and
focused builds used separate caches. These checks do not establish remote-owner
or multi-owner statement-snapshot support, nor complete the SQL extraction parity gate.

## Initial measurements

Local Apple Silicon, ReleaseSafe compiler microbenchmark: two 10,000-operation
runs averaged approximately 674–999 ns with 928 bytes of retained arena capacity.
A 100,040-byte commented query retained 398 bytes after lexer scratch release.
Rejecting a 256,000-byte token-heavy input at a 128-token quota took approximately
469–792 ns versus 1.356–1.808 ms to tokenize the complete input. That last comparison is
an admission-work reduction, not an end-to-end query throughput claim.

A synthetic executor regression counts 10,000 rows in 40 pages under a 512 KiB
allocation quota, proving pages are released rather than retained as a relation.
A 64-row UPDATE regression verifies that overwritten values are not requested
from storage, a 2 KiB assignment is owned once rather than 64 times, and peak
request allocation stays below 128 KiB. This is an allocation/projection test,
not a claim about end-to-end storage throughput.

The bounded index-costing fixture has 96 primary rows. An intersected descending
range visits six index records without primary lookups; adding a competing
selective covering index requires seven planning probes and selects a one-record
scan, again without primary lookups. These deterministic work counts test reduced
storage work; they are not an end-to-end latency benchmark.

## Current CLI example

Against an existing relational table with a `name` column:

```sh
antfly sql --database default --namespace public \
  --statement 'SELECT _id, name FROM users WHERE _id = $1' \
  --parameters '["user-42"]'
```

Results remain ordinal arrays, so duplicate column names are not lost. The
`--limit` option is an admission ceiling; put `LIMIT` in SQL when intentionally
requesting a prefix. Transaction/session commands still fail explicitly.

## Durable range protection implementation boundary

The implementation now includes replicated activation, native bucket counters,
pending-writer reservations, retained-read/RPC proof export, durable session
observations and owner-fenced distributed prepare. Savepoint rollback keeps read
observations while discarding staged writes. Versioned private prepare envelopes
make older receivers reject guarded requests instead of ignoring their proofs.
The transaction suite passes 96 cases, including allocation-failure coverage for
guard ownership and durable savepoint round trips.

Tracking is inactive by default: inactive native batches perform one activation
probe and no counter writes. Active batches update each touched bucket once.
The initial 257-bucket layout is conservative: common-prefix keys share a bucket,
so it is not an adaptive low-contention interval index. TTL-enabled reads reject
guarded snapshots because clock-driven visibility needs an explicit transaction
time contract. Hosted owners route the idempotent activation command through
each catalog-fenced data-Raft group; a failed partial activation is safe to
retry, but it is not an atomic table-wide epoch switch. Guarded Lite sessions
remain unsupported: the local source does not advertise the capability until
session invalidation across in-place restore and the local owner/commit path
have end-to-end fault coverage.
The acceptance checklist below remains the release gate for the broader shape,
not a claim that every deployment or fault workload has been completed.

Remote retained reads now mount a service-authenticated owner protocol, with
catalog-scoped capabilities, bounded owner leases, sequenced pages, cancellation,
and exact typed-row metadata. Distributed statement capture admits each selected
leader before freezing any participant, then validates fresh quorum observations
against the frozen applied index and leader term. Quorum validation never waits
for Raft apply while holding an apply freeze; contention, a newer committed index,
or a leader/incarnation change aborts the statement. These are statement snapshot
guarantees, not durable serializable transaction protection.

Repeatable-read/serializable admission requires capable read and write providers;
the full deployment contract requires all of the following together:

1. Activate tracking through an explicit replicated catalog capability transition
   under the native apply mutex, after draining/rejecting existing prepared
   writers. A guarded read must reject an inactive database; it must never enable
   tracking through an unreplicated read-side write. This avoids unconditional
   write amplification for document/vector workloads that do not use SQL isolation.
   Persist bounded logical-primary-key bucket generations in the same native
   transaction as primary changes. Instrument `DocStore.Txn` and `BatchTxn`
   put/delete/append paths, covering document and relational rows, FK actions,
   TTL deletion, transaction resolution, and bulk restore. Increment each changed
   bucket once per transaction; never derive predicates from physical LSM runs.
2. Capture bucket-generation tokens from the exact native read transaction and
   export them through retained cursor/RPC pages. Bind tokens to table identity,
   schema, and a durable data incarnation. An empty range must produce tokens too.
3. Extend existing durable exact-value predicates and shared read guards to these
   bucket keys. Pending writers must reserve affected buckets before a concurrent
   reader prepares a shared guard; checking only committed generations permits a
   prepare/commit race. Use a separate shared writer-reservation namespace, so
   unrelated concurrent writers in one conservative bucket do not acquire an
   exclusive bucket intent and serialize unnecessarily. Every ordinary writer
   must check reader guards. Acquire bounded, sorted bucket sets rather than a
   global table mutex.
4. Retain and deduplicate tokens in the transaction session, including savepoint
   rollback, and route their validation/read-guard acquisition through the same
   atomic participant prepare as writes. Preserve original snapshot identity
   across subsequent statements, rather than silently opening a fresh snapshot.
5. Fence restore publication, split/merge, ownership movement, and database reopen
   with durable incarnation rules so counters cannot reset or transfer ambiguously.
   Distributed restore already allocates target table/range identities and carries
   the metadata incarnation; reuse those fences rather than generating divergent
   random epochs on individual replicas. In-place CAPI restoration needs explicit
   native session invalidation before enabling guarded CAPI transactions.
   Recovery must resolve shared guards and pending writer reservations together.

Required acceptance coverage includes empty-range phantoms, pending writer versus
reader-prepare races, FK/TTL mutations, restart/recovery, restore and topology
changes, cancellation and lost prepare responses. Fixed logical buckets trade
bounded metadata/locking cost for conservative conflicts; benchmark write
amplification and false-conflict rate before selecting the bucket granularity.
Adding counters alone would add write cost without providing the missing guarantee.

### Ordered artifact activation gate

The expanded asynchronous-artifact protocol is still **not advertised**. The
current implementation must not be treated as full feature activation. The
following mechanisms are installed behind that gate:

- Compact, owned publication commands and bounded replicated upload chunks.
  Finalization authenticates chunks outside the apply lock, then rechecks the
  manifest root and original begin index in the final transaction. Effects,
  provenance, semantic receipts, terminal transport acknowledgement, quota
  release, and chunk retirement share that transaction. Standby replay carries
  the small upload control, not another copy of the assembled publication.
- Transport acknowledgement storage is a fixed 1,024-entry durable ring, with
  constant point-addressed retirement per decision. Eviction removes only a
  retransmission cache entry; the durable semantic receipt/guard path remains
  authoritative. Active uploads separately retain their count/byte quotas.
- Large dispatch jobs yield after two chunks, retaining one queue admission,
  the original owned command, and their accepted chunk position. Scheduler
  pressure preserves progress; shutdown drains ownership. The compact command
  is not decoded or hashed again for each scheduling slice.
- Producer admission leaves two job slots and 16 MiB for activation controls
  in both the local queue and durable upload store (within their existing
  total limits). The upload root authenticates its control class; assembly
  verifies that class against the decoded command. Restart reconstructs the
  same quota partition, and retirement releases the exact class's reservation.
- Fully staged uploads survive loss of their finalize job. Each chunk updates
  an incarnation-bound, checksummed receipt bitmap in the same transaction as
  its bytes. Recovery examines at most eight manifest/bitmap pairs, never the
  payloads, and queues a 133-byte recovery hint through reserved control capacity.
  It releases the snapshot before dispatch, retains its cursor on refusal, and
  fairly wraps ready uploads at the idle maintenance cadence. Finalization still
  authenticates the complete command; a stale begin-index hint cannot consume a
  pruned/recreated upload. Terminal retirement and pruning also remove the bitmap.
- Incomplete uploads have a bounded idle detector (eight observations, five
  minutes without chunk progress). Its clock chooses proposals only. Ordered
  abandonment compares the incarnation, root and authenticated progress in the
  writer transaction, refusing retirement after a racing chunk or completion.
  Restart and clock regression restart the grace period; ready retries alternate
  with idle retirement so pending coverage cannot strand upload capacity. No
  semantic receipt, terminal success, or producer completion is manufactured.
  Lost producer output still requires the required-stream execution driver to
  regenerate it from the pending exact-input obligation.
- Root-producer discovery now appends immutable-catalog requests to the existing
  replay journal, atomically with a checksummed per-obligation dispatch sequence.
  Scheduling leaves semantic obligations pending. Primary/dependency re-dirtying
  resets dispatch even at the same primary position; stale catalog/input guards
  cannot consume work. Bounded, budgeted pages release their read snapshot before
  admission, keep a fair local cursor, and back off after refusal or a full sweep.
  Reopen tests distinguish durable dispatch from completion. Scoped downstream
  enumeration and completion callbacks still belong to the gate below.
- Pending root streams now have bounded, proof-aware retry sweeps independent of
  transport lifetime. Each receiver verifies the immutable plan's provider
  requirements outside the writer, skips current accepted live/absent output,
  and atomically appends only pending requests with a separate durable retry
  cursor. Accepted pages advance metadata without empty journal records. The
  original dispatch cursor, obligation revision/count and completion evidence
  remain unchanged. Checksummed owner-local round IDs prevent repeat admission
  within a sweep; input/dependency changes invalidate stale prepared retries.
  Per-document pages rotate fairly and preserve their ordinal across passes.
  Persisted scheduling time prevents cold-owner churn from continually resetting
  the five-minute retry grace; wall-clock regression may retry early but grants
  no acceptance. Runtime deadlines use the owner's awake clock. This repairs
  lost root requests even before upload Begin, so no extra transport-to-document
  reverse index or mass dispatch reset is needed. Tests cover lost queues,
  reopen, aborted retry transactions, stale inputs/rounds, bounded accepted
  prefixes, absence, same-byte output replacement with a surviving receipt,
  record corruption and retry backoff. Complete scoped callbacks, producer
  fault recovery and all-member completion remain separate activation gates.
- Authoritative coverage markers/counters are scoped by namespace, producer
  epoch, and catalog digest. Replica-local legacy markers are not scanned into
  distributed authority: each epoch initializes empty counters transactionally
  and credits only ordered publications. Statistics capture the authority and
  counters in one atomic point read, with bounded retry across epoch changes.
  Missing counters in populated authoritative generations remain pending, even when a
  publication would leave its coverage marker unchanged. A pending finalization
  retains its upload for retry rather than creating a terminal acknowledgement.
- Raft baseline discovery prepares owned, bounded pages outside apply (128 keys,
  64 KiB or 2 ms, allowing one oversized key up to the cursor limit). Pages bind
  the observed Raft cut, expected cursor, physical row keys and fixed upper bound.
  Followers apply the selected page instead of scanning their local work records.
  Cursor progress, current-input obligations and the Raft/outbox cut commit
  atomically. Foreground mutations capture behind-cursor and new tail writes;
  the fixed bound prevents continuous inserts from extending the migration.
  Queue admission is not completion, and a missing dispatcher cannot advance it.
- Dirty work is keyed by namespace and authority epoch. The scheduler work-page API
  returns owned pages with exact input revisions and epoch-fenced cursors;
  the snapshot is released before work can be dispatched. Both current-work
  scans and obsolete-epoch reclamation are capped at 128 records, 64 KiB, or
  2 ms (one oversized key may advance). Reclamation rechecks the authority
  before committing and never changes active pending counts or grants seal.
- Strict current-stream verification resolves accepted provenance by receipt
  identity, revalidates its complete logical read-set, and checks every output's
  revision witness without reading large artifact bodies. This is deliberately
  distinct from retry acknowledgement: shared graph outputs can be legitimately
  superseded and need projection reconciliation, not repeated inference.
- Accepted producer proofs now also stage a document-ordered reference in the
  same atomic apply, including publications whose output is absent. Variable
  key construction occurs before the apply lock; cold epoch retirement recovers
  the document from the bounded proof rather than duplicating long document
  keys on the write path. A bounded, two-phase maintenance page verifies old
  references and document entries outside its writer transaction, then retires
  them with reference counts and proof bodies under an authority CAS. This is
  the range-seekable source evidence index
  needed for bounded snapshot export, not itself a portable proof stream or a
  receiver-local adoption certificate. A pinned, document-range proof-reference
  reader now seeks directly to encoded binary lower bounds, pages by entry and
  byte limits, and checks each index against its live source reference and
  proof-body presence. It is candidate enumeration, not portable validation of
  the proof's causal input/output scope. The ordered-artifact target
  passes, including allocation faults, LSM apply, 129-proof paged retirement,
  binary range/resume, corrupted-reference rejection, pinned-reader preservation,
  and current-epoch isolation.
  Accepted proof bodies now use APF3 v3, a compact checksummed binary record of
  the same bounded logical read set, historical output compare-and-swap guards,
  and output digests. Those output guards are kept distinct from causal inputs:
  receiver adoption must compare the imported postimage, not replay the donor's
  pre-publication guard. APF3 removes JSON's
  binary-key expansion so one legal proof fits within the AFB2 block ceiling;
  it does not itself add a portable proof block or confer receiver authority.
  The 206-case ordered-artifact target passes, including forged-field and
  allocation-failure codec tests.
  Certified AFB2 source-copy snapshots now include APF3 proofs once per
  publication digest, plus a compact bitmap naming only output sources whose
  receipt still selects that proof at the immutable cut. Export checks the
  document index and source reference in that pinned cut. The source
  certificate covers the new private block; AFB2 reader capability v5 rejects
  older decoders. One-pass and checkpointed import verify proof framing,
  checksum, source namespace, selected output ordinals and ordering, then
  store the bytes under an inert source-proof prefix, never donor receipt or
  authority keys. Borrowed decode avoids another proof-sized allocation.
  The 208-case ordered-artifact and 28-case retained-transfer targets pass,
  including binary document keys, full source-pin reopen, source certificate
  verification and checkpointed staging import. Receiver-local adoption and
  retained-effect/tail provenance transfer remain open.
  Online merge now reads source proofs from certified AFB2 objects through the
  bounded positional descriptor and carries them in a distinct provenance
  page/chunk payload, not vector/graph effects. The receiver validates APF3
  before apply and commits only inert, source-pin-scoped evidence keys with
  the page receipt. A durable pending bit refuses the final tail certificate
  until receiver-local adoption is implemented; transferred donor bytes do
  not grant acceptance. Tests cover a donor/receiver snapshot, lost page
  replies, a restart between three 1 MiB chunks, wrong-source keys, and the
  finalization barrier. Receiver-local adoption, retained-tail provenance,
  and bounded reclamation of abandoned merge evidence remain open. Replicated
  snapshot publication and final-fence apply now reject a provenance-free
  certificate if producer authority activated after its immutable pin, so a
  late activation cannot turn a previously empty proof stream into an
  apparently complete receiver cut. Import now also checks APF3 source order,
  physical position namespace, artifact guard ownership, output key family,
  duplicate outputs, document ownership and the live scoped-producer guard
  rule before storing candidate bytes;
  a valid checksum alone is not an adoption certificate. Bounded off-lock
  receiver preparation can now recapture every causal primary/artifact input,
  compare its current value and timestamp, and own the receiver's physical
  revisions. It also checks selected output digests, tombstones and donor-range
  ownership; changed inputs or outputs yield a stale candidate rather than
  inheriting donor positions. This remains candidate work until an ordered,
  replayable receiver transaction revalidates and installs local receipts.
  A receiver-side writer-transaction verifier now repeats the exact primary,
  artifact-input, and selected-output checks against local physical revisions,
  including same-byte ABA changes. Candidate preparation also owns the source
  pin, APF3 checksum, donor producer identity and selected-source bitmap after
  release of the transfer buffer. Preparation also requires the certified
  donor binding to match the APF3 epoch/digest and the receiver's ordered
  semantic catalog; writer revalidation repeats the receiver catalog and
  active authority fence. APF3 can encode a receiver-owned adopted origin that
  commits the donor pin, proof checksum and selected subset into a local
  publication digest; no caller installs receipts from it yet. A reusable
  receiver producer plan now validates both exact and semantic catalog
  bindings once per source cut, maps index/graph producer names and kinds to
  receiver-owned physical generations in O(1) per proof, and rejects donor
  generation drift. It also maps enrichment authority epochs and resolver
  definition generations, including default-zero resolver generations, from
  the authenticated catalog pair. Graph effect rebinding and promotion
  identity remain open; mapping is candidate identity, not acceptance.
  The receiver can now construct that plan from the donor catalog durably
  bound to the exact merge attempt at its checkpoint and the current ordered
  receiver catalog. It rejects an attempt change or local catalog drift without
  a donor round trip or per-proof catalog transfer.
  A selected direct-index candidate can now build a receiver-owned APF3 body
  off-lock from remapped local inputs and selected postimages. The body binds
  donor lineage through its adoption digest, drops donor historical output
  preconditions, and refuses graph/non-index adoption; it does not stage
  receipts or grant authority until ordered receiver apply is wired. The
  adopted-proof staging participant now takes selected source ownership from
  APF3 effects rather than fabricated mutation bodies, stages only those
  receipts and document/artifact references, and fences each artifact against
  its actual receiver-local revision. It still requires a certified-evidence
  fence and causal/postimage revalidation in the same ordered transaction;
  graph rebindings remain gated. For an absent selected output with no copied
  revision, adoption staging can now CAS absence and mint a receiver-local
  tombstone revision at its ordered apply position. A lost-response retry is
  accepted only if that revision and proof reference still name the same
  adopted proof; an unrelated same-position write cannot earn a receipt.
  Certified online-merge proof import now stages a 32-byte witness atomically
  with each inert APF3 record. It binds the already-verified APF3 checksum to
  the selected bitmap, avoiding a second multi-megabyte hash; writer
  revalidation CASes only the witness under the apply lock.
  Online artifact-page apply now writes receiver-local artifact revisions in
  the same batch as each transferred afterimage or deletion. Those revisions
  are the exact output witnesses later adoption needs, and replay-only pages
  cannot advance them to a new Raft position. Receiver candidate preparation
  treats a present output without such a revision as stale before constructing
  an adopted proof; absent outputs can still acquire a tombstone revision in
  ordered apply. Selected direct-index preparation now owns the receiver
  candidate, encoded adopted APF3, exact output positions and document
  reference keys as one bundle before apply; releasing the imported proof
  buffer cannot invalidate the prepared transaction inputs.
  Direct-index proof adoption now has a private isolated data-Raft command and
  a distinct standby payload version. Preparation owns the exact receiver
  merge-state/progress bytes; ordered apply compares both again and validates
  local inputs, postimages, catalog and import witness before atomically
  committing adopted receipts, proof references, the Raft marker and HA
  outbox. A stale copy attempt consumes only its ordered marker. Data-Raft
  admission requires protocol 17, which remains above the current activated
  version; no merge coordinator submits this command yet. Bounded proof
  enumeration, retained-tail adoption, graph/scoped-producer rebinding,
  completion discharge and all-member activation still remain open.
- Completion verification now reconciles shared graph winner/count outputs
  against their current accepted projection, while keeping private contender
  and stream outputs revision-exact. Replacement proofs and effect lookups
  are cached within the read; large artifact bodies are not reread.
- After baseline discovery, maintenance prepares bounded provenance-validation
  pages outside apply. A typed, binary-safe ordered control advances the exact
  cursor only at its unchanged mutation epoch, and atomically re-dirties stale
  streams using current input revisions. Followers apply the selected page;
  they do not rescan their local state. The control uses reserved upload/queue
  capacity and retains its exact apply identity through standby replay.
  Completing this validation pass does not clear required-stream obligations.
  The seal transaction requires both drained obligations and a completed,
  unchanged validation epoch; an empty work queue cannot bypass this guard.
- Producer input capture binds compiled templates, physical generations, and
  catalog bytes from one pinned write-plan epoch. It no longer deserializes
  the index catalog or borrows live generation numbers for each input row.
- Resolver callbacks inherit accepted upstream causal input sets, including
  neighboring primary rows and artifact dependencies. Sorted source sets are
  merged linearly and existing guard ordinals are remapped once per proof.
  A current accepted stream is checked before candidate/provider execution,
  avoiding repeat inference after lost replies. This is causal inheritance
  within an owner, not cross-owner provenance adoption.
- Resolver and asset providers now share an owned causal-input context. Copy
  and deferred asset callbacks capture the pinned producer definition before
  execution, inherit accepted upstream proofs, and publish through ordered
  transactions instead of local artifact/skip-state writes. Missing inputs
  publish explicit absence; durable receipts suppress repeat inference after
  acceptance. Provider queue admission alone leaves replay pending. Tokens
  retain digests/proofs, not duplicate document/upstream bodies, and their
  retained memory participates in provider batch budgets.
  Shared producer dispatch treats bounded queue pressure and leadership loss
  as pending control state, not terminal inference failure; cancellation and
  malformed-command/allocation failures retain their distinct dispositions.
- Asset publication derives full-text projections and downstream replay from
  the authenticated catalog. Consumer membership is compiled once per
  publication, and shared document coverage uses point reads across sibling
  provenance/revision witnesses rather than treating one deleted asset as a
  deleted document. Old or stale sibling bytes cannot earn authoritative
  coverage, and large output bodies are not reread for that decision.
  Epoch activation now initializes full-text coverage alongside vector/graph
  coverage. Direct and deferred callback regressions exercise real leases,
  Raft acceptance, stale upstream rejection, absence, and duplicate suppression;
  storage tests cover output authorization, shared coverage and reopen.
- Acceptance receipts and source-proof references belong only to output
  owners, including explicit deletion outputs. Read-only dependencies still
  invalidate the complete input digest but cannot certify their own producer
  work. Duplicate detection uses the same bounded output-owner bitset.
- Chunk output-set preparation now owns one canonical encoding shared by
  storage and text projection, with per-row scratch reuse and allocation-fault
  cleanup. Private checksummed manifests describe contiguous ordinals, total
  payload bytes, and a streaming content digest; replacement validation requires
  the complete old-tail retirement. The prepared writer fence uses one manifest
  point read, rejects stale replacements, and treats missing inventory as a
  baseline gap. LSM rollback/reopen tests cover inventory/member atomicity.
  Root chunk callbacks now use ordered publication when an inventory exists:
  they pin the catalog and input, skip already accepted work before chunking,
  and atomically publish members, tail deletions, inventory, receipts, provenance,
  coverage, and projection work. Preparation authenticates member identities and
  parses each payload once outside apply; commit checks the actual old count with
  one manifest point read. Shared text coverage is reconciled once per document
  and consumer rather than once per chunk. Missing inventory remains control-plane
  pending without provider invocation or replay acknowledgement, and now submits
  bounded ordered inventory-reconstruction controls. Unit-scoped callbacks and
  staged generations above atomic command limits remain part of the producer
  activation gate below.
- Unit-scoped chunk receiver preparation now shares the root replacement
  validator while binding an independent unit ordinal space. The scope is the
  canonical parent-unit key; authorization checks its document, configured
  extraction producer, member identities, payload parent fields and complete
  tail retirement. It resolves accepted parent provenance off-lock and requires
  the consumer to inherit every causal input. Final apply checks a fixed-size
  provenance reference alongside the manifest fence; absent acceptance cannot
  be replaced by plausible unit bytes. Unit projections do not grant terminal
  document coverage. A scope-specific accepted-set reader cannot substitute
  root or sibling evidence. This is the receiver boundary, not activation of
  extraction/unit callbacks: the accepted upstream unit inventory, bounded
  scope census, and large staged publication path remain required.
- Unit chunk input capture now binds the immutable extraction template and
  selects its child from the pinned catalog once per capture session. This
  follows the existing extraction-owned execution model without inventing a
  competing top-level worker template. Each captured input owns the payload,
  inherited causal sources, exact unit identity, and previous chunk manifest;
  no snapshot or catalog lease needs to survive provider execution. A missing
  unit with a live primary requires accepted upstream deletion provenance,
  rather than being inferred from raw absence. Scope, allocation-failure,
  snapshot-lifetime and retirement-fence regressions exercise this boundary.
  Unit inventory reconstruction uses the same extraction-owned authorization
  on sender and receiver, including when no standalone child worker template
  exists. Its bounded ordered pages reconstruct only that unit's old set and
  resume across reopen without manufacturing producer acceptance or a root
  manifest. Primary source identity is captured once per pinned input session.
  This is preparation machinery, not completed extraction callback activation:
  accepted unit-set enumeration and staged publication still gate that path.
- An ordered per-unit chunk callback now consumes that owned accepted input,
  reconstructs missing inventory through scoped ordered census controls, and
  releases storage/catalog leases before chunking. It decodes the retained unit
  and its provenance once, preserves page/document offsets and transcript timing,
  and uses the existing chunk payload encoder. Publication atomically replaces
  the complete bounded unit set and retires old tails; accepted retries skip
  chunking, and accepted upstream deletion produces an empty replacement. The
  callback-to-Raft regression supplies upstream acceptance explicitly and covers
  inventory bootstrap, payload provenance, allocation failures, retry suppression,
  and retirement. This is not extraction-worker activation: enumeration of the
  accepted complete unit set, durable cross-unit continuation, and staged output
  sets beyond the atomic command limit remain required before wiring that worker.
- Chunk reconstruction now has a bounded off-lock pager and portable fixed-size
  digest checkpoints for root/unit scopes. Physical chunk writes and tombstones
  advance a deduplicated stream revision even before its manifest exists;
  reconstruction resumes only in the same catalog epoch and unchanged stream.
  The new, unreleased manifest uses a resumable hash chain rather than serialized
  standard-library hash internals. Discovery still creates no inventory or
  producer completion proof. Root callbacks now order reconstruction pages through
  the existing census transport. Each receiver independently recomputes the
  bounded page and checks the exact before/after digest; sender time slicing is
  converted to an observed row limit for deterministic receiver verification.
  The final writer checks root, catalog, predecessor and stream-revision fences,
  and commits the inventory with its applied marker/outbox while deleting the
  temporary checkpoint. Partial pages resume after restart, and selected immutable
  generation heads cannot be mistaken for empty old-layout streams. This is
  receiver-local inventory, not producer acceptance or all-member agreement:
  staged-generation adoption or explicit replica-baseline agreement is still
  required before distributed retirement may depend on it.
  Reconstruction discovery and verification use transient physical scans; no
  provider invocation or query-cache admission is required. LSM tests cover
  multi-page receiver verification, lost-reply replay, rollback, restart,
  same-byte mutation races, forged page claims, all checkpoint-byte corruption,
  allocator failures, and final checkpoint removal. Root callback tests cover
  the missing-inventory-to-accepted-output lifecycle separately, preserving the
  distinction between inventory metadata and producer completion.
- Chunk query projection now walks a cursor in the caller's pinned snapshot
  rather than retaining a second, owned raw-prefix result alongside projected
  JSON. Ordinary stream names use borrowed key views; binary names retain the
  owning decode path. Projection cloning reserves container capacity before
  ownership transfers through a shared owned-JSON helper, and nested special-field
  handoff is allocation-fault safe. Exclusion-path allocation failures propagate
  instead of silently omitting requested exclusions. Chunk projection now uses
  a snapshot-bound logical cursor that merges legacy scopes and generation heads
  in key order. Selected heads suppress the whole old scope, including empty
  outputs; a prefix-successor seek skips obsolete tails without walking members
  or their derived descendants. Root/unit neighbors and binary producer names
  remain distinct. Generation-only streams are discoverable without legacy rows.
  Index consumers, graph consumers, transfer, and recovery still need the same
  head-selection semantics before production generation publication is enabled.
- Sparse ordinal projection now uses the logical chunk cursor, narrowed to the
  selected producer so unrelated generated streams are not decoded. Artifact
  discovery and document identities share one primary read snapshot; doc-number
  resolution reuses one sparse snapshot rather than opening a transaction per
  member. Embedding-source discovery also streams borrowed rows instead of
  retaining a complete physical range. Regressions keep retired unit postings
  alive and verify exact projected membership, duplicate input ordinals, binary
  producer isolation, and allocation-fault cleanup. This does not establish an
  atomic cross-store cut or certify derived embedding freshness; those still
  require the ordered publication/input-proof integration.
- Staged chunk generations now have checksummed scope/input/catalog-bound
  identities, bounded append preparation outside the writer, durable resumable
  progress, byte-verified duplicate pages, and a guarded atomic head switch.
  Snapshot views perform one seek plus sequential member reads, and never use
  legacy tails once a head selects a generation (including an empty output).
  Public artifact point lookup uses the same pinned-head resolver and releases
  decoded identity ownership on absence. LSM tests cover restart, aborted head
  publication, stale head/input rejection, duplicate append, allocation failures,
  divergent legacy tails, and old-reader visibility after member deletion.
  Document-extraction state recovery now enumerates logical unit and child
  chunk keys from one pinned read; a selected (including empty) extraction
  head suppresses obsolete physical units, and selected chunk heads suppress
  their legacy tails. Navigation-key recovery shares that read and avoids
  loading block values. This closes a recovery-reader visibility gap, not the
  ordered producer-publication or provenance-adoption gate.
  Ordered graph planning also reads a selected extraction root through that
  generation and inherits its accepted head proof, not a stale physical root.
  A head replacement invalidates prepared graph commands at Raft apply; the
  graph callback still needs producer-side extraction activation and the
  remaining cross-owner adoption barriers.
  These are storage/read foundations, not production activation: ordered command
  admission, receipts, quotas, producer regeneration, remaining index/graph
  readers, and transfer/adoption must be integrated before publishing heads in
  production. The storage lifecycle now reserves increasing stream incarnations
  atomically with begin and durably fences retirement before removing members.
  Bounded GC pages resume from persisted ordinal progress, reject active heads,
  and remove terminal attempt state. A single checksummed, scope-bound high-water
  mark prevents delayed begins from recreating reclaimed identities without
  keeping permanent per-attempt tombstones. Pinned readers retain old members
  through MVCC. Append/GC budgets include physical key bytes, with a bounded
  one-member escape for large keys. Fault tests cover restart mid-GC, duplicate
  pages, late append/publish/begin, empty abandoned attempts, and incarnation reuse.
  Authenticated retirement policy, admission, recovery scheduling and ordered
  command/standby wiring remain required before activating this lifecycle.
- Staged-generation recovery now has a bounded metadata-only discovery pager
  with checksummed, scope/authority-bound restart cursors. Root and unit scopes
  cannot consume each other's attempts. Pages verify state identities and the
  selected head's complete, non-retiring state, copy no member bodies, and release
  their read snapshot before returning. Incarnation proposals are read-only;
  ordered begin resolves racing proposals and an aborted reservation is reusable.
  Tests cover reopen/resume, catalog drift, binary scopes, malformed cursors,
  proposal races, and allocation-fault cleanup. Discovery must be scheduled
  fairly and wrap because concurrent begins may sort behind a cursor; scan-end
  is neither an admission barrier nor a producer completion certificate. Recovery
  still needs ordered resume/finalize/retire dispatch and producer-input recovery.
- Extraction generations now have a distinct document-owned physical namespace
  while sharing the existing staged append, incarnation reservation, atomic
  head switch, bounded retirement and recovery machinery. Chunk and extraction
  streams with identical document/producer names cannot share clocks, heads or
  recovery pages. Extraction head changes participate in owner obligations and
  their own stream revision; private rows remain non-visible preparation state.
  Namespace and LSM lifecycle tests cover partial append/reopen, duplicate pages,
  empty replacement, retirement and pinned old readers. This is the shared
  storage lifecycle, not an accepted extraction directory: complete unit
  enumeration, ordered authorization and reader/transfer integration
  still gate publication from the extraction worker.
- Extraction generations now have an immutable named-output directory over that
  lifecycle. Names are bound into each checksummed payload envelope and the
  generation digest; name/ordinal metadata and payload progress commit together.
  Duplicate names cannot silently replace previous pages. Selected point lookup
  reads one name entry and one payload; sequential enumeration and retirement
  use ordinal metadata without loading unit bodies. Checksummed resume positions
  bind the generation identity, so a head change cannot reuse an old ordinal.
  Page admission accounts for both directory indexes and payload keys, with a
  bounded single-large-member path. LSM tests cover reopen, duplicate pages and
  names, exact lookup read counts, allocation faults, metadata-only GC, empty
  replacement, and pinned old readers; codec tests reject corruption and cross-
  generation metadata. This is the named storage directory, not worker
  activation: semantic output authorization, accepted head publication,
  ordered upload/finalization, and durable cross-unit consumers still need wiring.
- Unit inputs, resolver inputs, and public artifact point lookup now select the
  extraction directory in their pinned snapshot. Typed unit names avoid
  repeating the document and producer in every directory member. Head absence
  is guarded before initial publication; an existing head forbids fallback to
  obsolete physical rows, including for an empty replacement. Unit chunk
  preparation requires the selected head guard or both head-absence and exact
  physical-unit guards. Receiver certification binds the accepted head proof;
  nonempty child output cannot consume an absent unit. Missing causal proof
  stays pending, including physical absence. Regression coverage includes binary
  unit IDs, allocation faults, cross-producer isolation, public lookup, stale
  head guards, and pinned reads across retirement. This does not authorize
  extraction publication or activate the worker/cross-unit scheduler.
- Authorized unit capture sessions can now enumerate an accepted extraction
  directory in bounded metadata-only pages. A page owns its logical unit keys,
  selected-head guard, and inherited producer proof; it releases every storage
  cursor before returning. Proof identity must match the selected generation's
  input digest and extraction producer. Non-unit metadata consumes the visit
  budget and advances the continuation, while a deferred large member never
  advances it. Empty directories require the same accepted proof. This supports
  cross-unit work discovery without loading all unit bodies or keeping provider
  work inside a snapshot; discovery/end-of-page is not child completion. The
  producer-side discovery/retirement driver and extraction publication
  authorization are still release gates. Unit-head guards are also recognized
  by command-level scoped validation, not just the receiver-specific validator.
- Unit capture sessions also provide bounded retirement discovery over existing
  child scopes. Membership checks use one named-directory metadata lookup,
  never a unit body, so a replacement with no units can still find every old
  child scope. Current units and other child producers are excluded. Returned
  scopes own the same accepted head/provenance as desired-unit pages. Checksummed
  continuation tokens bind the extraction generation and canonical child scope;
  stale heads, malformed cursors, corrupt inventories and cross-child resumes
  fail closed. Visits and copied key bytes are bounded, including a single-large-
  identity progress path. Discovery must wrap/revalidate because concurrent child
  inventories may sort behind a cursor: scan-end is explicitly not an obligation
  discharge or child-completion certificate. Retirement publication and the
  producer-side driver still need integration; receiver reconciliation is below.
- Desired-unit and retirement pages have a shared receiver-side child verifier.
  Each child must have current accepted provenance, retain the parent's causal
  inputs, and guard the exact selected parent head/revision. Retirement also
  requires a zero-count accepted output: an empty raw inventory is insufficient.
  The verifier obtains counts from the already-read manifest or generation spec
  rather than scanning chunk bodies, and returns an observation retaining any
  cross-document dependency fence alongside the page receipt digest. This is a
  prerequisite for durable page advancement, not a document-completion
  certificate.
- Unit-child reconciliation now has a durable receiver registry and bounded
  ordered `reconcile_units` controls. The receiver derives desired/retiring
  pages from its own predecessor, verifies every child before advancing, and
  rechecks root, catalog, observation and predecessor fences in the same writer
  as the applied marker/outbox. A changed owner materialization cut resets the
  prefix; cross-document inputs additionally retain their validation epoch.
  Claims bind the parent/child identity and generation but not a replica's
  physical root; stored records and local closures are root-bound. Last-page
  retries are idempotent, including terminal retries. Closure is for one child
  requirement only and cannot substitute for the parent's or sibling's proof.
  Obsolete root/epoch records use the existing bounded maintenance collector.
  Producer scheduling and the semantic extraction publication path still need
  wiring. Completion-plan consumption uses an independent unit-child witness,
  not the extraction parent's or another sibling's receipt.
  Reconciliation uses a sorted union of child inventories, selected generation
  heads, and historical raw unit-chunk scopes. It deduplicates overlapping
  representations and seeks past each raw scope's entire tail instead of walking
  its chunks. Continuations remain canonical inventory-scope identities, so
  discovery survives removal of one representation without skipping another.
  Physical cursors do not hydrate external chunk payloads; raw discovery inspects
  at most the first stored entry of each scope. Missing inventories or accepted
  receipts remain pending rather than silently certifying raw/head-only scopes.
  Ordered-artifact coverage includes checkpoint restart, terminal lost-reply
  retry through Raft apply, stale-predecessor rejection, allocation failures,
  corrupt/root-rekeyed records, and invalidation by a behind-cursor insertion.
- Completion plans compile extraction-owned chunk children directly from the
  catalog, independently of top-level worker templates. Each child has a stable
  definition-bound requirement and a local parent-template ordinal excluded from
  portable identity. Template/catalog reordering preserves identity; changing
  the child definition invalidates it. Configured extraction children remain
  pending requirements even when their parent has no executable template.
  A compiled name index replaces repeated child-catalog parsing and parent
  searches in unit authorization/reconciliation controls. The completion
  verifier consumes only current root-bound child reconciliation closures;
  parent extraction, projections, native effects and sibling requirements
  remain independent and must still pass their own gates.
- Completion scheduling now follows its durable verified prefix and proposes a
  bounded unit-reconciliation control when the next requirement is a blocked
  extraction child. Proposals own their data and release the read snapshot
  before queue admission. Missing child receipts remain pending; admission does
  not move either checkpoint. Existing maintenance polling rediscovers refused
  submissions and resumes accepted pages without a tight retry loop. This wires
  receiver reconciliation, not the still-gated extraction writer, scoped
  provider discovery/callbacks, or all-member completion barriers.
  Verification-only sessions avoid redundant primary-document capture/hashing;
  producer-input sessions retain that capture. A point-probe regression rejects
  primary document/typed-row body reads while verifying a current child closure.
  Validation: the ordered-artifact target passes 196 tests with zero failures or
  leaks, including proposal rediscovery, durable-prefix selection, missing-child
  refusal, allocation failures, restart, and the primary-body-read prohibition.
- Unit producer discovery now has a separate generation-bound continuation for
  desired children and obsolete-scope empty replacements. It selects only
  missing/stale child receipts, while rejecting stale parent evidence and
  propagating corruption. Cursor identity binds the authority/catalog,
  document, parent and child; checksummed framing rejects phase confusion and
  foreign-child resume. Owned pages retain no read snapshot and provide a
  point-only admission fence. Accepted child writes do not rewind discovery;
  changing the selected parent generation requires rediscovery. Scan exhaustion
  is not completion and subsequent sweeps must wrap for behind-cursor inserts.
  Durable scoped-job admission and actual replay callbacks are still required:
  the current thin worker journal coalesces generated references into document
  keys and rebuilds root requests, so adding unit fields to those references
  alone would silently discard the scoped work identity. Admission must retain
  each child/unit/generation together with cursor advancement atomically.
  Validation: 197 ordered-artifact tests pass with zero failures or leaks,
  including missing-result selection, obsolete-scope retirement, stale-parent
  rejection, wrong-child cursors, allocation failures, and a discovery reader
  that rejects extraction-unit payload reads.
- Scoped unit jobs now have a root-local durable outbox admission layer. It
  atomically stages the discovery cursor and generation-bound unit identities,
  deduplicates exact admissions, rejects stale predecessors, and accounts for
  outstanding job count/bytes across pages and generations. Capacity rejection
  occurs before writes and cannot skip the refused page. Payload preparation,
  hashing and cursor encoding happen before the writer; writer-side guards use
  fixed metadata and bounded point probes. Root/epoch cleanup uses the shared
  bounded registry collector. This is not worker activation: the worker must
  still execute/retire scoped jobs with current-generation receipt checks before
  freeing headroom.
  Validation: 198 ordered-artifact tests pass with zero failures or leaks. New
  coverage checks atomic job/cursor persistence across reopen, quota refusal
  without partial insertion, duplicate admission, stale predecessors, allocation
  failures, binary identities, and root/generation-bound checksums.
- Scoped-job admission now joins the durable document wakeup through the shared
  replay transaction, backlog admission, catalog fence and standby write gates.
  Refusal aborts both jobs and wakeup; metadata-only discovery pages advance
  without empty replay records. Thin journal coalescing no longer needs to carry
  unit identities because the same transaction retains those in the outbox.
  Bounded outbox reads own their returned identities, verify each record once,
  and include older generations so workers can retire obsolete jobs and release
  capacity. Workers must wrap discovery cursors for behind-cursor insertions.
  Automatic scoped callback execution and worker-loop integration remain gated.
  Validation: 198 ordered-artifact tests pass with zero failures or leaks,
  including refusal with no visible replay/job insertion, metadata-only pages
  with no wakeup, reopen with the wakeup and jobs intact, and allocation-fault
  coverage of bounded reads across both current and obsolete generations.
- Scoped-job retirement now requires a current accepted child result, including
  an explicitly empty result for a unit absent from the selected parent, or a
  newly accepted parent proving that the queued generation is obsolete. Missing
  receipts remain pending; callback submission never frees capacity. Parent and
  child verification share the reconciliation verifier. A bounded retirement
  session amortizes catalog binding and parent verification across jobs, while
  each prepared retirement owns point-only writer fences. Job deletion and
  counter release commit atomically without advancing the discovery revision or
  discharging stream obligations. Current counters allow concurrent admission
  and retirement; duplicate retirement does not decrement twice. The DB entry
  point uses the existing authority, snapshot and apply fences. The worker still
  needs to invoke these paths around actual scoped callback execution.
  Validation: 198 ordered-artifact tests pass with zero failures or leaks,
  including accepted-result resolution, stale-parent fencing, unfinished jobs
  retaining capacity, batched obsolete-generation retirement, allocation faults,
  idempotent deletion, exact counter release, and pinned-reader visibility.
- Scoped-job worker turns now own bounded scan pages and persist an independent,
  checksummed, root/catalog-fenced continuation. Failed jobs retain their quota
  but cannot pin every attempt to the first page; exhaustion wraps, and inserts
  behind the continuation are retried on the next sweep. Cursor commits are
  idempotent, stale concurrent commits fail, and receipt retirement/admission
  do not rewind worker progress. The DB entrypoint uses the existing standby,
  snapshot-replay, and apply fences. Generation-bound callback capture rejects
  an obsolete/missing parent before unit-body reads or provider execution;
  stale/already accepted callbacks also avoid deserializing chunker settings.
  Maintenance follows the existing blocked completion prefix and either
  submits a verified control or atomically admits scoped jobs with their wake.
  Discovery resumes its own durable cursor, resetting only on parent replacement
  or sweep exhaustion. The runtime job callback is generation-bound; automatic
  bounded worker execution and receipt retirement still need wiring, including
  fair scheduling across children, route selection, and large staged outputs.
  These scheduling records grant no acceptance or activation evidence.
  Scope-local outbox capacity refusal leaves admission unchanged and lets the
  maintenance document sweep continue. Validation: 199 ordered-artifact tests
  pass with zero failures or leaks, including durable continuation/reopen,
  failed-job wraparound, stale cursor CAS, allocation failures, parent-generation
  reset, blocked-child scheduling, and stale callback rejection.
- Nonempty child outboxes now have a root-local, per-document scheduling
  directory. First-job admission installs its fixed-size entry atomically;
  last-job receipt retirement removes it in the same transaction. Document
  cursors select one child with a bounded seek, without walking catalog nodes
  or unit bodies. Independent child and document continuations can commit
  together, preserving fair retry across failing siblings and wrapping for
  insertions behind the saved key. Live-child counts let the last retirement
  remove document cursor metadata in O(1); a first-admission generation fence
  rejects old cursors after a drained queue is refilled. Cursor commits preserve
  concurrent live-child count changes. Document-key hashing is prepared before
  the apply lock; final counter/directory fences use fixed-size keys and values.
  Root/epoch GC handles both registries.
  The directory itself grants no acceptance evidence; the replay worker and
  receiver-verified retirement paths below consume it.
  Validation: 200 ordered-artifact tests pass with zero failures or leaks,
  including sibling retry fairness, binary document isolation, behind-cursor
  admission, current-key retirement, joint-cursor reopen, concurrent count
  preservation, drained/refilled generation fencing, last-child cleanup,
  directory corruption rejection, and obsolete-root GC.
- The local worker checkpoint can now commit both fair continuations and up to
  128 receiver-verified receipt retirements in one store transaction. A stale
  cursor aborts the whole page without dropping jobs. A duplicate retirement
  returns after an absent-job point read, even if a later parent generation
  has invalidated the old receipt; present jobs still require the current
  catalog, authority, and accepted-result fences. Callback selection and
  execution remain the activation boundary.
- Required-work maintenance now visits one document's scoped outbox after
  native input closure, checks up to eight jobs per child against receiver-local
  accepted or obsolete receipts, and checkpoints retirement with both fair
  cursors. Pending callbacks remain queued. Documents without an outbox use a
  point lookup and never open a physical worker cursor. Job preparation reuses
  the bounded page's owned bytes instead of refetching each record from the
  LSM; the writer still checks exact bytes and current receipt fences. This is
  automatic receipt reclamation, not automatic producer execution or stream
  completion.
- The scoped unit chunk callback now takes its child range and placement from
  the accepted typed unit payload, so its route is independent of the number
  of chunks later produced. Chunk and unit range kinds remain distinct even
  when they share the same range ID. A remote unit route is rejected before
  chunking or publication until the routed child command path is available;
  callers cannot supply an unverified route for a durable job. Dynamic
  child-range inspection and routed remote publication remain open.
- Generated replay wakes now select one child and a bounded four-job page from
  the durable directory. The runtime clones the parent template and releases
  the read snapshot and plan before invoking each generation-fenced callback;
  a stable DB-owned context commits both fair cursors under the ordinary HA,
  snapshot, and apply gates. The replay remains pending while the document has
  any queued jobs, including on a wrap turn, and receiver-verified maintenance
  retires them. Missing dispatch or durable-turn infrastructure also fails
  closed while an outbox exists. A restart fixture checks the document-only
  wake, unavailable hooks, and refusal of the durable turn commit without
  cursor advancement or job loss. After receipt retirement, the fixture
  accepts a fresh typed parent generation, admits its current unit job, and
  verifies that bounded worker turns submit an actual child publish command
  while retaining the job pending receiver acceptance. The receiver then
  applies that command, retries the still-queued job without a duplicate
  submission, and retires it and its document wake only through accepted
  receipt maintenance. This wires local
  callbacks but does not complete remote child placement, large staged
  outputs, all-required stream closure, or the distributed activation fault
  matrix.
- Persisted unit encoding now lives in a shared typed payload contract rather
  than the runtime implementation. Ordered unit chunk callbacks decode through
  that contract once, bind document/producer/unit identity, reject provenance
  overrides of identity/text, conflicting mirrored metadata, and route
  contradictions (a local route has no remote owner; a committed remote route
  has one), and verify the
  current logical unit fingerprint before invoking a provider. Transcript/text
  ranges and document offsets are checked against the unit body. Owned decoded
  slices survive release of the raw input; preparation no longer constructs a
  second merged JSON object. The encoder preserves the existing artifact shape.
  This is the contract needed by extraction receiver preparation, not activation
  of the still-gated extraction writer or its ordered continuation protocol.
- Generation heads are now canonical read-set guards, not generic artifact
  mutation authority. The physical commit hook stamps both the exact head and
  its stream witness in the same native/Raft transaction; private staging rows
  do not invalidate visible inputs. Owned producer observations record head
  absence before first publication and use the selected head as the immutable
  set's provenance witness afterward. Asset callbacks and resolver reads select
  those inputs in one snapshot and inherit the head's accepted causal proof,
  including for empty output sets. Missing producer certification remains pending
  rather than adopting a legacy member receipt. Root asset reads, like unit
  reads, resolve through the selected extraction head; a selected empty set
  cannot fall back to stale physical root bytes. Downstream asset publication
  validates that root membership and the accepted producer proof off-lock,
  then fences the receiver-local proof reference at atomic apply. LSM tests
  cover private append, rollback, head replacement, stale/absent guards,
  downstream acceptance, stale/empty guard rejection, and pinned old observations.
  Ordered staged-generation finalization must still publish that proof together
  with the head, receipts, coverage, and consumer work before these paths activate.
- Accepted asset retries now drive ordered graph consumers before completing,
  including absence and deferred-provider acceptance races. They plan against
  the accepted value and its causal proof in one pinned snapshot, without copying
  the asset through an extra preliminary read or rerunning the provider. Derived
  replay under producer authority consumes committed graph effects rather than
  calling the legacy primary-state materializer. The erased document-store
  adapter forwards snapshot forks while retaining payload/import-reader lifetime.
  Regression coverage includes transitive generation-head guards, queued graph
  rejection and accepted-proof invalidation after a head replacement, graph queue
  refusal, real edge publication/absence retirement, accepted retries, binary
  graph-owner keys, and forked snapshots surviving parent close. Graph keys use
  their own suffix grammar rather than public artifact-ID parsing; nested review
  ownership remains restricted to the resolver source scopes. These
  repairs do not complete staged-generation publication, stream drain/seal,
  receiver adoption, or the distributed activation fault matrix.
- Required-work observations carry durable owner-local revisions in addition to
  primary source positions. Re-marking a dependency advances the revision even
  when the primary is unchanged; completing/removing a work record cannot reuse
  an old identity. Journal admission compares that revision atomically with its
  dispatch marker and replay append. Completion also requires the current local
  revision and authority, after receipt validation in the same writer snapshot.
  These revisions are not portable completion certificates: an ordered driver
  must validate each receiver's current obligations and causal receipts rather
  than copying a leader's local token. The required-stream enumeration and
  ordered drain/seal driver remain open.
- Root-template dispatch is now paged rather than allocating and journaling the
  whole catalog for each document. A borrowed fixed-size page preserves the
  immutable plan's upstream-first order, caps requests and escaped-key byte
  estimates, and permits one bounded oversized request. The next-template cursor
  and last dispatch sequence commit with each journal append. Partial progress
  remains schedulable across restart; dependency changes reset it under a new
  work revision. Dispatch completion still does not discharge an obligation or
  certify dynamically scoped unit/chunk, resolver, graph, or promotion streams.
- Logical chunk cursors support exclusive ordinal resume with direct seeks into
  the selected generation, skipping shadowed legacy tails and preserving unit
  boundaries. Resume keys remain positions, not completion certificates; a
  multi-snapshot consumer must validate its work/input revision. Stored embedding
  input fallback and source-hash checks now resolve selected generations in one
  snapshot, including empty output, rather than reading obsolete physical rows.
  Fallback extraction streams rows without retaining a second full raw scan.
  Ordered materialized dense/sparse callbacks now use selected logical chunks
  and retained vector scopes together; other chunk/unit production paths and
  stream completion are still required before activation.
- Scoped chunk-vector commands now authenticate their logical member and exact
  output, require head and output-precondition guards, inherit the accepted
  upstream proof, and project only to matching immutable-catalog consumers.
  Dense/sparse payloads and dimensions are validated before apply. Input capture
  owns the selected bytes and causal read set without retaining an LSM snapshot
  across provider work; provider identity uses the compiled write-plan template
  rather than reparsing catalog JSON per chunk. Provenance decoding happens
  off-lock under a tracked preparation budget; serialized apply rechecks the
  inherited inputs and a fixed-size receiver-local proof reference. Replacing or
  retiring that reference invalidates preparation even if output bytes match.
  Tests cover allocation failure, shared consumers, uncertified input rejection,
  proof-reference races, and sparse projection through actual Raft apply.
  A member receipt does not grant document-wide completion. Full stream
  reconciliation and drain/seal remain activation gates; this
  receiver-local fence is not a portable provenance-adoption certificate.
- Materialized chunk-vector callbacks prepare bounded dense/sparse provider
  batches with owned causal inputs under tracked preparation memory. The
  snapshot and catalog read fence close before inference or dispatcher calls.
  Accepted retries skip provider invocation; publication and absence cleanup
  use the ordered command path, never the legacy direct artifact writer.
  A merged candidate cursor includes existing vector scopes whose chunk has
  disappeared, so shrinking/empty selected generations retire obsolete vectors.
  It resumes across binary names, generation/root/unit boundaries, deduplicates
  live scopes, and avoids rescanning the physical tail ahead of every selected
  member. Tests exercise allocation failures and actual callback-to-Raft output
  acceptance and absence retirement. Completion remains pending: this scan is
  not a portable exact-input stream certificate. Durable scheduler continuation,
  unit/extraction/promotion paths, and the
  stream-completion/obligation driver still require integration before activation.
- Producer censuses now have a document materialization revision, staged in the
  same physical transaction as primary and visible artifact mutations. New unit
  scopes, vector/graph changes, generation-head switches, and nested resolver
  outputs invalidate the owning document's census; unrelated document writes do
  not. Private generation uploads and aborted head publication do not advance
  visibility. One revision write per affected owner avoids per-stream fan-out.
  Receipt-only chunk-vector passes pin this witness across page snapshots and
  inspect the complete accepted proof without decoding it twice. Foreign-input
  proofs additionally pin the mutation epoch, so neighbor changes cannot bless
  a mixed-input pass. A publishing pass cannot also certify completion. These
  observations are preparation fences, not durable/portable completion records;
  the ordered stream-completion command, required-stream
  closure, receiver adoption and drain/seal integration remain open.
- Accepted-member chunk-vector census pages now persist receiver-local
  checkpoints with their exact input observation, exclusive binary cursor,
  member count and rolling receipt digest. Atomic compare-and-swap rejects
  concurrent/regressing scans; duplicate pages are idempotent, and stale input
  observations permit a fresh census rather than trusting old progress. EOF is
  explicitly enumeration, not stream closure: it neither advances replay nor
  discharges a document obligation. Runtime retries reuse current checkpoints
  without repeating provider work. LSM reopen, corruption, allocation failure,
  stale-page and lost-reply tests exercise the persistence contract. Keys have
  namespace/epoch prefixes; obsolete checkpoints share bounded obligation GC,
  preserving pinned readers and current-epoch state through catalog churn.
  Portable completion commands, provenance-adoption certificates,
  durable scheduler continuation, full stream closure and drain/seal are still
  required; these local checkpoints must not be adopted as remote certificates.
- Local census checkpoints are now bound to the durable physical-root
  incarnation in both their key and checksummed value. The resident DB injects
  this identity into replacement runtimes; provider configuration and imported
  metadata cannot override it. Ordinary reopen preserves useful progress, while
  imported donor keys are outside a fresh root's lookup namespace and re-keyed
  donor bytes fail validation. Unknown physical identity fails closed before
  provider invocation or publication. Cleanup also retires foreign-root records
  in the active catalog epoch by seeking over the current root's entire prefix.
  Tests cover reopen identity, fresh-root metadata copies, forged re-keying,
  absent identity, and old/current-epoch GC with pinned readers. This local
  binding does not replace portable source/provenance adoption or distributed
  completion/capability barriers.
- Chunk-vector censuses now distinguish physical-tail budget yields from EOF.
  Checkpoints retain an inclusive physical scan position independently of the
  last accepted logical member, allowing ignored-only pages to survive restart
  without inventing accepted members or repeatedly inspecting the same tail.
  Accepted-only passes yield after each durable page; physical scans share
  visit, byte and elapsed-time budgets. Binary-key, unrelated-output, expired
  deadline, allocation-failure and LSM-reopen tests cover ordering and resume.
  Publishing-pass scheduling still needs separate time slicing; these changes
  do not make the entire reconciliation bounded.
  Checkpoint encoding is prepared into owned bytes before the writer fence;
  input validation and checkpoint CAS remain in the committing transaction.
  No completion, obligation discharge or capability activation is inferred.
- Logical chunk scans now share the page budget with physical output scans.
  A checksummed merge position retains the next generation ordinal and legacy
  row independently, including progress through empty generation heads and
  ignored legacy rows. Census checkpoints persist that position with CAS
  checks that forbid either merge input from rewinding. Prefetched logical
  members retain their predecessor position when an older output is returned,
  so snapshot-per-result retries neither skip members nor repeatedly traverse
  empty heads. An expired deadline still permits forward progress in both
  inputs. Ordered stream-closure commands and receiver verification remain
  open; a resumable local scan is not a portable completion certificate.
  Regression coverage includes checkpoint reopen without accepted members,
  independent merge-input rewind rejection, allocation failures, and
  snapshot-per-result scans through 64 empty heads and obsolete outputs with
  an operation-count bound to catch repeated empty-head traversal.
- A receiver-side chunk-vector census primitive now recomputes bounded pages
  from the immutable producer plan and current accepted provenance. Claims
  bind the producer/index generation, authority, owner input witness, receipt
  chain, and both cursor positions; verification takes a receiver-supplied
  predecessor rather than trusting a sender's local checkpoint. Deterministic
  visit/byte limits reproduce page boundaries without provider invocation.
  Owner-local progress ignores unrelated mutation epochs; foreign-input proof
  participation pins the epoch. Dense/sparse callback tests cover live and
  empty streams, missing acceptance, forged predecessor/result claims, stale
  inputs and allocation failures. This is read-only preparation; the progress
  registry and command below supply the commit boundary. Upstream stream
  closure, obligation discharge, adoption and distributed fault validation
  remain open. EOF alone
  still cannot certify that an upstream producer has finished creating scopes.
- Receiver-verified pages now have a separate durable progress registry. An
  owned prepared record carries the receiver's expected predecessor; the final
  writer rechecks the input witness, physical-root identity, seal state and
  predecessor CAS before installing it. Aborted writes do not advance the
  registry, lost-reply duplicates are idempotent, and competing or stale pages
  cannot overwrite newer progress. Stale input observations restart the scan.
  Fast paths still check the immutable producer plan, including empty streams.
  Root-bound records authenticate both page claims and progress bytes and share
  bounded old-epoch/foreign-root cleanup with other producer metadata. Tests
  exercise real LSM transactions, abort/retry, competing pages, stale prepared
  work, corruption and allocation failures while preserving replay position
  and pending obligations. This writer primitive is not by itself a stream
  closure command or an activation certificate.
- Census pages now have a bounded binary-safe publication control command.
  Receivers resolve the immutable catalog template, independently verify the
  claimed page outside apply using a tracked working-set allocator, then
  commit progress together with the Raft applied marker and the existing
  standby marker/outbox machinery. Stale source/catalog, pending provenance
  and sealed-source outcomes use the same durable rejection path as other
  producer controls. JSON/compact codec tests bind producer identity, limits
  and page claims; dense/sparse callback tests exercise actual Raft installation,
  duplicate apply and stale-generation/input rejection. Upstream closure,
  obligation discharge, provenance
  adoption and distributed crash/promotion validation are still open.
- Materialized chunk-vector workers now automatically drive bounded verified
  census pages through the publication control dispatcher before attempting
  provider work. Missing acceptance falls back to materialization; current
  enumerated progress avoids repeated scans and dispatch. The worker releases
  its read, plan and ownership fence before enqueueing, and queue refusal does
  not advance durable progress or replay. An accepted prefix can advance even
  when its next member is pending, but that member's cursor is not skipped.
  Tests exercise dense/sparse dispatch, refusal/retry, multi-page continuation,
  accepted-prefix verification, and no reinference after acceptance. Normal
  publication waits no longer log warnings, inflate error counters or inherit
  exponential provider/pipeline backoff. Workers still retain replay debt at
  enumeration: upstream closure and exact obligation discharge remain required.
- Census EOF now requires a current accepted root-chunk manifest, including
  explicit empty output, and inherits that producer's complete causal inputs.
  Missing manifests stay pending and altered manifest bytes fail the accepted
  output digest check. Selected generation heads take precedence and require
  their own accepted proof; they cannot borrow an older manifest's acceptance.
  Dense/sparse regressions cover these failures, unaccepted baseline manifests,
  and the valid empty result. This proves only the root replacement boundary, not
  unit/DAG closure or document completion. Catalog authorization is now bound
  once per pinned census/provider batch and reused across members; per-member
  upstream provenance, source capture and output CAS remain independent.
  An operation-count regression verifies one ordered-catalog read across
  sixteen live/absence captures with independent accepted-proof validation.
- The receiver now persists root-only chunk-vector stream closure in the
  census transaction (AVP2), alongside the Raft/standby control markers. Closure
  is derived locally from the pinned catalog and verified enumeration; no
  sender-supplied bit can grant it. Unit/extraction and neighbor-dependent scope
  sets remain open pending their upstream scope certificates. A closure handle
  owns its document identity and rechecks physical root, causal observation and
  exact registry version in the final writer without scanning or decoding
  provenance there. Dense/sparse tests cover live and empty closure, allocation
  faults, partial/missing progress, root mismatch, stale input and unrelated
  writes. One closed stream still does not discharge document obligations or
  advance replay; it must participate in the all-required-stream verifier below.
- Immutable write plans now compile a catalog-wide completion checklist, not
  just the generated-provider queue. It contains mandatory native/authored
  effects, every provider template, every index projection, and separate
  resolver and promotion requirements. Resolver output, upstream scope kind
  and target table remain explicit. Stable framed identities exclude local
  template ordinals; catalog-bound cursors expose allocation-free pages capped
  at 128 requirements/64 KiB (with single-item progress for larger identities).
  Tests cover all index kinds, empty-provider catalogs, promotion requirements,
  canonical ordering, stale catalog cursors, count/byte pagination and allocator
  failures. A requirement is not acceptance: the completion executor and the
  unresolved producer/scope handlers still have to certify every node before
  clearing document work. Provider ordinals map directly to canonical nodes,
  and stream closure handles bind their requirement ID for that verifier.
  Provider identity hashes use the same exhaustive definition-field selection
  as authorization, excluding only row/replay identity and consumer routing.
  Cursor fingerprints cover both catalog bytes and the complete canonical
  requirement set, so adding a requirement cannot reuse an old ordinal cursor.
  Identical provider definitions shared across consumer routes coalesce into
  one requirement while preserving direct ordinal lookup and separate index
  projection requirements; distinct provider inputs never coalesce.
  Compiled definition lookup also resolves row-specific requests without
  scanning the entire template list; execution authorization still compares
  the canonical template's complete definition and fences the active catalog.
  This checklist does not enable protocol 15.
- Required-stream completion now has a distinct private ordered control. The
  work driver prepares bounded pages and submits them without discharging local
  work on queue admission. Every receiver independently verifies the exact
  before/after page identity against its pinned catalog and causal cut; portable
  fingerprints exclude physical roots and local obligation counters. Receiver
  verification uses the sender's observed requirement count rather than its
  machine-dependent deadline. Final apply checks receiver-local root, catalog,
  work revision, predecessor and witness fences, then atomically commits either
  a prefix checkpoint or exact obligation discharge with checkpoint deletion,
  the Raft applied marker, and standby outbox. No terminal certificate remains
  per document. Missing requirement verifiers still stop progress; all-member
  evidence agreement, repair/retry coordination and drain/seal remain separate
  activation gates. A sender's completed page is not remote acceptance.
  Extraction-owned producer scopes now use a separate receiver-local closure:
  it authorizes the immutable template, verifies the fully published named
  generation and accepted head proof/inputs, then carries exact head bytes,
  the proof reference, and bounded private generation-state CAS witnesses into
  the final writer. Child streams remain separate requirements. Missing heads
  stay pending, and head-byte or private-state mutation invalidates a prepared
  parent witness without rescanning units under apply. Allocation-failure
  coverage exercises witness preparation and release. This does not activate
  the still-gated extraction writer, portable adoption or all-member drain/seal.
  LSM regressions exercise native-only completion on two independent roots with
  different work revisions, receiver evidence missing/present after restart,
  rollback, duplicate delivery, stale inputs, forged claims, allocation failures,
  and actual work-driver submission. A separate indexed-table test keeps work
  pending at an unverified index requirement; the 257-requirement engine test
  checks deterministic bounded page claims, restart and final checkpoint deletion.
- Completion prefixes for indexed catalogs now pin a durable receiver-local
  projection lifecycle epoch. Sidecar creation/replacement, status or generation
  changes, configuration identity changes, watermark regression, same-cut count
  replacement and checkpoint removal revoke old evidence before publication;
  ordinary monotonic watermark advances do not. Primary-metadata resets revoke
  inside their transaction. Failed sidecar publication may leave a conservative
  revocation, never a new sidecar with an old completion prefix. Plans without
  index requirements do not read this fence. Portable page identities exclude
  the local epoch value; each receiver still checks its own fence at commit.
  This supplies revocation, not index durability evidence: actual projection
  witnesses and their publication/recovery wiring remain activation work.
  Checks cover restart of a revoked completion prefix, unchanged document/work
  revisions, portable fingerprints across local epochs, corruption, monotonic
  progress, reset rollback and allocation failure between revocation and sidecar
  replacement. The ordered-artifact target now includes the shared apply-state
  suite, including concurrent sidecar writers and checkpoint-format regression
  tests, rather than testing only the new control path.
- Materialization revisions retain the exact receiver-local replay boundary of
  their owner's visible mutation. The physical transaction observer grants a
  boundary only for a fresh all-effects journal append paired with its advancing
  next-sequence marker. Unjournaled/imported changes and ambiguous journal batches
  retain an explicit absent boundary; they cannot borrow another document's old
  journal tip. Unrelated writes therefore do not continuously move the target
  needed for a document's projection evidence. This field is local evidence,
  not portable producer identity or proof that an index has applied the record.
  The PR-only materialization record has one strict versioned encoding, without
  a legacy decoder. Regression coverage checks namespace/version/truncation,
  exact replay capture, stale journal-key reuse, unrelated writes, abort and
  reopen. Live dense/sparse/graph resets revoke projection completion before
  closing storage; interrupted full-text reset also revokes before clearing.
  Full-text rebuild initiation durably publishes a rebuilding checkpoint and
  restart marker before destructive reset, and publishes clean only after
  backfill and sync. A restart-marker publication fault must preserve the old
  physical index while retaining explicit rebuilding debt. These boundaries do
  not activate index completion: physical projection witnesses and coordinated
  publication/recovery still need their own implementation and release evidence.
- Projection evidence preparation has a nonblocking guarded sidecar snapshot:
  it retains the existing checkpoint-publication lock across decoded checkpoint
  access and final primary-metadata fencing. This prevents reading a new
  revocation epoch together with an old clean sidecar while its replacement is
  in flight. One snapshot supports multiple index lookups; absent entries are
  explicitly absent rather than fabricated clean zero-watermark records. Busy
  publication yields for retry, and allocation/error paths release the lease.
  Independent raw reset or catalog changes still fail the final transaction's
  authority/epoch check. Writer reopen revokes local projection evidence before
  loading physical indexes; read-only/status opens do not mutate this fence.
  Tests cover lease lifetime, busy retry, allocation failures, missing sidecars,
  authority/lifecycle changes and writer versus read-only reopen. The guarded
  snapshot is not itself physical evidence; physical validation and aggregate
  certificates supply the additional checks described below.
- Full-text replay for activated physical owners now publishes a checksummed
  projection seal in its own index metadata before advancing the external
  applied-sequence sidecar, on both direct and batched/coalesced replay paths.
  The seal binds physical root, namespace, immutable coverage generation,
  configuration identity and replay cut. Publication forces index/WAL durability
  before writing the seal; retries do not regress its cut and finish any pending
  seal durability barrier. A different physical identity cannot reuse it.
  Unpublished managers have no serving-root authority. Reset and structural
  segment removal delete the seal in the same index transaction as the data
  change, rather than relying on a later best-effort primary cleanup. Tests
  exercise byte corruption, monotonic retry, wrong-root rejection, reopen,
  retained pre-reset readers, real full-text replay and modeled power loss/reset
  sync failure. These seals establish the full-text physical publication
  boundary only: automatic certificate refresh, startup/transfer adoption and
  other index-kind adapters remain open.
- Full-text physical validation now joins the guarded sidecar to the live
  generation's seal. It rejects missing/nonclean/ahead checkpoints, mismatched
  root/namespace/config/coverage generation, incomplete rebuild markers and
  pending repair/admission. Progressive query serviceability does not override
  corpus-wide repair debt. Catalog and per-index apply ownership are retained
  until evidence publication; try-lock acquisition avoids a lock-order cycle
  with replay publishers. A final primary-transaction check repeats the local
  lifecycle/catalog fence and rejects newly durable managed admission. The
  sidecar lease must outlive this physical guard. LSM replay tests cover wrong
  generations, busy retry, allocation cleanup, new admission and a forged clean
  sidecar ahead of physical data. Split pruning serializes with the index apply
  lane and revokes both primary evidence and the physical seal before changing
  the corpus, including mixed-segment replacement (which is not equivalent to
  ordinary compaction). The guarded generation is the prerequisite for the
  aggregate evidence publication described below.
- Full-text aggregate projection certificates now have a strict key-bound
  encoding and transactional issuance from a retained physical guard. One slot
  per index replaces old roots/epochs instead of accumulating per-row or
  historical certificates; index removal deletes the slot in the same catalog
  transaction. Same-identity publication is monotonic and idempotent. Readers
  reject damaged certificates; a newly validated physical guard can reconstruct
  that derived record without trusting its damaged predecessor. Completion
  can consume the record against a document's exact local replay boundary and
  performs only metadata point checks in the final writer. New source mutations,
  lifecycle changes, root changes, stale authority and insufficient coverage
  invalidate the witness. Missing/unrecorded source boundaries require the
  completed snapshot-adoption proof described below; no global journal tip is
  substituted. The ordered completion verifier now
  supports this full-text requirement alongside native/provider requirements.
  Tests cover certificate corruption/slot substitution, aborted and duplicate
  issuance, unknown requirement identities, wrong roots, lagging coverage,
  reopen invalidation, catalog-drop cleanup and a native-plus-full-text ordered
  completion. Leader discovery and receiver preparation now automatically refresh
  missing/lagging full-text certificates before opening their proof snapshot.
  Refresh shares the completion engine's exact resume state and bounds work to
  the next visit/byte-limited page, avoiding starvation beyond the first 128
  requirements. Valid cached coverage uses only metadata probes; missing
  evidence shares one nonblocking sidecar lease, validates physical generations
  outside the primary writer, and repeats fences at commit. Leader maintenance
  also yields between indexes on its time budget. Busy leases leave work pending;
  catalog/source races retain ordered rejection semantics on receivers. Tests
  cover busy retry, a cached page without any sidecar file, and receiver-local
  reconstruction after deleting the discovery certificate. A two-root LSM
  fixture rejects a copied leader certificate, reconstructs the receiver's own
  evidence during ordered apply, and retries the same entry after a lost reply.
  Broader historical adoption, other index kinds and all-member drain remain
  release gates; completed full-text snapshot adoption is described below.
- Authority activation now captures a strict, checksummed receiver-local replay
  boundary in the same primary transaction. This is the immutable historical
  baseline cut, not a projection certificate. Repeated activation retains the
  original cut even after the journal advances; in-memory reservations cannot
  inflate it. A new epoch validates the previous boundary and rejects a
  regressed durable journal in the same namespace. Corrupt/missing boundary
  evidence for an existing authority is not reconstructed from today's tip.
  Native and ordered baseline enrollment validate this authority-bound record;
  native discovery repeats the boundary fence in its committing transaction.
  The private key is excluded from portable metadata. Codec and LSM tests cover
  byte corruption, abort atomicity, duplicate activation, uncommitted sequence
  reservations, restart, epoch replacement, malformed/regressed replay metadata,
  and an empty new namespace. Historical projection credit still requires a
  complete snapshot/replay adoption proof tied to this cut; replay-only seals
  and clean sidecars do not provide that proof.
- Under active artifact authority, physical input capture now advances a
  receiver-local source-gap epoch in the same transaction as an unjournaled or
  ambiguous materialization. Ordinary
  journaled writes leave it unchanged. Snapshot guards bind this epoch to the
  immutable activation boundary, including the absence of authority, so an
  activation race also invalidates a pre-activation candidate. Durable repair
  checkpoints persist the guard beside the original replay floor. Resumed
  candidates and final shadow activation recheck it; an invalidated candidate
  is discarded only after releasing its physical handles, then rebuilds from a
  fresh snapshot without failure backoff. Older candidate checkpoints without
  a guard must rebuild rather than receive inferred source completeness.
  LSM materialization tests cover journaled progress, unjournaled invalidation,
  abort and restart; checkpoint tests cover guard persistence, and full-text
  repair tests contrast source-gap restart with journal-only catch-up. This
  closes the source-gap fence needed by snapshot/replay adoption, but is not
  by itself historical projection or producer-provenance evidence.
- Completed full-text shadow snapshot/replay builds now persist an adopted
  baseline in the physical generation's seal before publishing its pointer.
  The seal binds the owning root, catalog generation, activation boundary and
  snapshot source-gap guard. Incremental replay preserves this proof but cannot
  create it; physical reset/removal retires it with the seal. Receiver-local
  aggregate certificates carry baseline evidence only while its source guard
  is current and its coverage reaches the immutable activation cut. Untouched
  pre-activation rows and recorded unjournaled rows included in that snapshot
  can now satisfy their full-text requirement using that proof. An unchanged
  source-gap epoch excludes later unjournaled mutations. Final discharge
  rechecks the source guard, exact row revision, local lifecycle, authority
  and certificate in the same primary transaction. Tests exercise both
  journal-only catch-up and a fresh build after an unjournaled source race,
  followed by real ordered baseline enrollment and native-plus-full-text
  completion of an unchanged historical row. A staged source-gap change rejects
  discharge. LSM tests cover same-cut proof strengthening, preservation across
  incremental replay/reopen and retirement on reset; codecs reject mismatched
  authority, missing baseline identity and insufficient coverage. Other index
  kinds, imported producer provenance and all-member coordination remain
  activation work.
- Full-text adoption discovery now feeds the existing durable generation-build
  scheduler on both leader discovery and receiver completion preparation. Clean
  idle generations with absent/corrupt/incompatible physical proof, or historical rows whose
  existing proof lacks a current baseline, request bounded adoption work;
  checkpoint/apply contention and existing repair are not treated as proof loss.
  Admission releases all physical/sidecar leases first, rechecks the exact
  authority and catalog under the structural/apply fence, and admits at most one
  new build per completion page. The revision-tracked scheduler name map
  deduplicates existing jobs in O(1), including paused and terminal jobs, without
  repeatedly scanning durable repair state per document. The dedicated
  `artifact_baseline_adoption` trigger distinguishes this work from corruption
  and operator requests and retains the serving generation while building.
  Imported seals bound to another root, namespace, generation or configuration,
  and seals behind the clean checkpoint, also request reconstruction; a sidecar
  cannot relabel physical evidence. Two-index LSM tests cover a foreign-root
  seal alongside an absent seal, busy discovery without false admission, bounded
  scheduling, duplicate no-ops, query availability, pause/restart persistence,
  ordinary worker execution and final ordered historical completion. This is
  local durable scheduling; all-member completion/retry coordination remains
  an independent activation gate.
- Document-wide dense/sparse provider streams now have receiver-verified
  closure handles alongside the materialized-chunk census handles. Preparation
  resolves current accepted provenance for the exact physical primary row or
  tombstone, including explicit absent output. A surviving transport receipt
  cannot certify a replaced output. Owned handles retain only bounded identity
  and revision fences; their final check uses three metadata point reads for
  document-local inputs, not vector payloads or provenance decoding. Foreign
  dependencies retain the additional mutation-epoch fence. These handles close
  one generated requirement, not native effects, index projections, or the
  complete document obligation; the all-required-stream executor remains open.
  LSM-backed regressions cover dense vectors on typed rows and sparse vectors
  on document rows, live/absent/deleted inputs, same-byte output replacement,
  unrelated writes, physical-root mismatch, allocator failures and reopen.
- Root chunk replacements and singleton asset providers now participate in the
  same all-required-stream verifier. Root completion requires current accepted
  manifest/generation evidence and the producer's latest reference, including
  explicit empty output; reconstructed inventories alone cannot close work.
  Singleton asset completion retains all accepted causal inputs, including
  upstream assets. Handles own their identity/fences, survive database reopen,
  and check only metadata in the final writer. Tests exercise real callbacks,
  live/empty/deleted owners, stale upstreams, manifest reimports, allocation
  failure and closure after restart. Projection, resolver and promotion nodes
  remain independent and cannot be skipped by provider success.
  Scope classification is compiled once into the immutable completion plan:
  singleton assets use document scope, document extraction retains its dynamic
  scope requirement, and upstream-unit chunks retain unit scope. Authorization
  shares exact definition lookup and catalog/owner fences with vector producers,
  eliminating per-row template scans and provider-JSON parsing. Root-chunk
  closure now uses a pinned, O(1) producer-scope lookup bound into the plan
  digest; duplicate or missing chunk producers remain fail-closed. Dynamic unit,
  extraction and neighbor scope closure remains pending its own verifier.
  Deletion regressions also fixed graph cleanup's tombstone validation: canonical
  empty ownership roots from the owning graph generation are permitted alongside
  zero visible-count witnesses. Nonempty state, segments, trailing bytes, wrong
  generations and other graph owners remain invalid; checks are fixed-width and
  allocation-free. Normal graph preparation still enforces catalog and exact
  mutation/count preconditions before accepting these cleanup records.
- Receiver-local completion accumulation now checkpoints strict prefixes of
  the complete immutable requirement plan. Pages are bounded by count, bytes
  and time; they retain exact obligation revisions, physical-root identity and
  causal materialization observations. Foreign-input requirements additionally
  pin the shared mutation epoch without penalizing owner-local requirements.
  Commit repeats the fixed-width catalog stamp, obligation/cursor CAS and
  read-only witness fences. A terminal page atomically discharges the exact
  obligation and deletes its checkpoint; a persisted EOF cannot grant credit.
  The checkpoint engine's multi-page fault fixture uses explicit test witnesses,
  while native/document/chunk stream adapters use actual accepted evidence.
  Projection, resolver and promotion handlers and the ordered drain-command
  integration remain open: generated-only success never bypasses those nodes.
  Obsolete epochs and imported root identities use bounded local reclamation.
- Vector ingress now distinguishes explicit authored values from generated
  output with a tagged origin, rather than inferring authorship from a missing
  source hash (multimodal provider output can also lack a hash). Dense/sparse
  envelopes preserve descriptive authored origin; contradictory origin/hash or
  graph envelopes are rejected. Direct-field index replay preserves that origin
  and ordinary portable backups use the raw-artifact path for authored vectors,
  avoiding lossy compact batches. Tests cover payload equivalence, malformed
  envelopes, allocation failures, and exact dense/sparse backup round-trips.
  This metadata is not accepted provenance or a completion certificate. Native
  writer-bound certification and receiver adoption remain required; flagless
  historical or imported vectors are not implicitly upgraded to authored output.
- Ordinary DB ingress and coordinated transaction resolution prepare receiver-local authored-vector acceptance
  for active publication epochs. It deduplicates exact primary/timestamp/vector
  postimages and hashes each once before opening the physical writer. The
  physical input-capture hook observes those bytes and issues acceptance in the
  same transaction as their source/artifact revision stamps; incomplete writes,
  replacement postimages, and retries cannot inherit prior observations. Records
  bind catalog, namespace, epoch, physical root, source position and output
  digest. Reads use revision point checks; raw imported origin flags grant no
  acceptance. Obsolete epochs/roots use the shared bounded reclamation walker.
  Native/Raft tests cover raw imports, missing retry postimages, source changes,
  re-keyed records, allocation failures, and dense/sparse outputs. Historical
  provenance adoption remains a separate requirement. Protocol 15 remains disabled.
  Identical dense projection replay now preserves the ingress artifact instead
  of rewriting it and invalidating its source revision; this also avoids a
  redundant vector WAL write. An LSM-backed DB regression verifies acceptance
  after full projection completion and reopening the same physical root.
- Native/base-vector completion now uses a receiver-local, resumable physical
  prefix census. Each 128-visit/64 KiB/2 ms page checks current authored acceptance
  or generated provenance without point-fetching vector bodies or materializing
  external blobs. Persisted cursors
  bind catalog, physical root, causal revisions and predecessor CAS; a restart
  resumes rather than rescanning the accepted prefix. A tombstoned owner with
  surviving vectors or a raw imported flag remains pending. The completion
  adapter consumes this closure, including native-only catalogs; it does not
  bypass independent projection, resolver or promotion requirements.
  Artifact-only mutations now reopen the owning document's work exactly once,
  preserving its primary input position while advancing its work revision.
  This prevents new scopes from hiding behind an earlier completed obligation.
  Maintenance runs the census even with no provider templates; progress requests
  another bounded turn, while missing evidence backs off. Fault tests cover
  130 dense/sparse vectors, cancellation, allocation failures, cursor races,
  restart, exact discharge and reopening after an uncertified vector appears.
- Current receiver-local authored evidence also closes the corresponding
  document-vector provider requirement and suppresses provider execution.
  Both paths bind the exact source and physical root, not the origin flag.
  Dense/sparse and batched-dense callback regressions require zero inference
  or publication calls for accepted authored vectors. Generated retry checks
  now require current provenance rather than a transport receipt that may
  outlive its output. Closure commit checks only fixed metadata fences and the
  accepted record version. Historical receiver adoption, non-document provider
  scopes and ordered all-required discharge remain separate activation gates.
- Coordinated resolution and ordinary ingress share one borrowed commit
  participant interface through backend type erasure. Attachment must precede
  mutations, retries reset observations, and the final callback can write only
  private metadata after physical source revisions are stamped. Unsupported
  backends reject participation. Callback failure rolls back the decision,
  primary writes and acceptance together; terminal lost-reply retries do not
  replay postimages or re-certify them over newer rows. Native/Raft fault tests
  and document/typed-row transaction API tests cover these boundaries. No
  participant, preparation pointer or callback is persisted as durable work.
  The DB regression reopens after durable intent preparation, resolves from
  recovered intents, waits for projection, and reopens again to verify local
  acceptance on both document and typed-row tables.
- Current-epoch authored acceptance retirement scans metadata only, with
  cold-cache admission and bounded 128-record/64 KiB/2 ms pages. Its durable
  cursor advances across live records, so a live prefix cannot starve stale
  receipts. Preparation releases the reader before the writer; commit repeats
  exact-record, artifact-revision, authority, root and cursor checks. Renewal
  racing cleanup therefore survives, and primary-only changes retain the
  authoring evidence of an unchanged output. Completed sweeps are cached at
  the durable native/Raft mutation clock. Mutations during a sweep force a
  follow-up pass (including keys behind the cursor), while idle maintenance
  performs point reads without reopening the certificate scan. Regression
  coverage includes a 257-certificate live-prefix/churn fixture, aborted
  cleanup, competing cursors, racing renewal, pinned readers, byte limits,
  native/Raft clock invalidation, epoch/root fences and restart. This is local
  reclamation, not historic provenance adoption or native-stream closure.

The ordered-artifact regression target covers upload refusal without false
success, restart/resume, pending-coverage retry without retransmission, accepted
graph provenance/coverage, exact standby control identity, and bounded terminal
retirement. Baseline coverage includes two owners with different local work
records, enqueue refusal, restart, duplicate pages, behind-cursor writes and
continuous tail growth. It also fills the producer-upload quota on both owners
before uploading/finalizing the baseline through reserved control capacity.
Wire tests cover binary row keys, control-class tampering and allocation failures.
Validation regressions cover two-owner replay, mutation racing an empty page,
new-leader discovery, duplicate apply, stale graph projection repairs, binary
repair keys, allocation failures, and standby control identity.
Obsolete-work reclamation tests preserve pinned readers and active counts while
removing a multi-page old epoch; cursors from that epoch cannot drive current work.
Upload recovery tests cover restart with pending coverage, queue refusal,
duplicate hints, stale incarnation fences, and payload-free fair discovery.
Runtime tests saturate producer admission while admitting a finalize hint, and
verify scheduler refusal and shutdown release the exact queue reservations.
These are component guarantees, not deployment activation proof.

Focused checks (from `zig/`, with `-Doptimize=debug`):

- `zig build antfly-ordered-artifact-test`
- `zig build antfly-retained-transfer-test`
- `zig build antfly-data-runtime-test -- --test-filter 'data runtime ordered artifact upload handoff'`
- `zig build antfly-storage-native-fk-test`
- `zig build antfly-standalone-initial-fk-test` (the six native FK/TRUNCATE
  integration cases require this storage-owner-linked target, not the general
  standalone runtime unit-test target).

Before advertising the expanded protocol, finish and validate:

1. Enumerate and schedule every required producer stream from the immutable
   catalog, including unit/chunk scope and shared-output reconciliation. Clear
   each exact-input obligation only after those streams are complete. Bounded
   receiver-verified completion controls and local work-driver submission are
   wired; complete the missing requirement verifiers and the all-member drain/seal
   coordinator (bounded replicated provenance validation is wired). Replicated baseline scan
   completion alone is not an activation certificate.
2. Complete chunk/unit/document-extraction, neighbor-context asset, and promotion
   producer preparation and actual callbacks (root chunk callbacks with an
   existing or receiver-verified reconstructed inventory, and direct/accepted-upstream asset callbacks are wired),
   including remaining input proofs and absence cleanup. Direct document-vector
   authored certification now bypasses inference; historical/adopted authored
   output still requires receiver-local adoption evidence.
3. Historic provenance carried with retained effects and snapshots, atomic
   receiver-local adoption certificates, and contender/promotion recovery.
   The direct-index ordered adoption participant is wired and tested locally,
   but its bounded coordinator, distributed retry outcomes, other producer
   families and admission/activation barrier are not complete.
4. Complete scoped regeneration through the required-stream driver and all-member capability/catalog
   barriers, followed by the distributed crash, lost-reply, leadership-change,
   and standby-promotion fault matrix.
   Root retries now derive identity from the existing exact-input obligation
   and immutable plan, not from transport staging. Finish regeneration for the
   remaining scoped producers and prove it across incomplete/retired uploads,
   membership changes and standby promotion. A retry is not stream completion
   or all-member evidence, and must not replace those barriers.

### PostgreSQL campaign validation (2026-10-06)

PostgreSQL is the SQL semantic authority; PostgreSQL 19 is the target and the
current independent oracle uses an isolated PostgreSQL 18.6 instance. The next
read/document batch resolves 103 original contracts (54 reads, 49 document
mutations), leaving 1,066 unresolved. Twenty-four legacy planner rejections are
explicitly superseded by tested guarded mutation execution. Neither oracle
admission nor an old schema's readiness/cardinality annotations grant completion
or authority.

Native execution now preserves function/CASE labels, admits PostgreSQL postfix
NULL tests and implements bounded Unicode-aware padding, repetition, reversal,
position lookup and bit lengths. A nested join buffering regression now owns
text/JSON before advancing upstream pages; the regression includes allocation
faults. The bounded scratch text workload processes 50,000 rows in approximately
101–116 ms in a debug build with 514 bytes of reusable scratch. This is an
absolute workload measurement, not a before/after speedup claim.

The PostgreSQL oracle validates typed complete results, SQL NULL provenance,
affected rows, untouched document state, assignment presence and valid ordered
LIMIT peer frontiers. Server-side cursors avoid buffering full read results.
All five recorded campaign evidence gates pass. The 251-read and 211-document
cohorts remain incomplete: remaining work needs shape-specific executable
profiles for typed arrays, temporal/regex functions, virtual document metadata,
root replacements, generated fields and constraint/index ownership. SQL syntax
or schemas that disagree with PostgreSQL must not gain positive parity credit
through SQLite emulation or fixture-only authority.

### Typed relation row boundary (2026-10-07)

Internal relation pages now retain owned complete Datums and share one
name-to-ordinal directory per page. They no longer build a JSON object plus
SQL-null and pattern side channels for every row. Array dimensions, lower
bounds, NULL elements, exact bigint values and pattern owners survive scalar,
join and grouped row adapters. Internal coercion borrows already-owned array
values without allocating or converting their JSON placeholder; incompatible
element descriptors and JSON-null substitutes fail closed. Primitive column
pages remain available, while relations containing arrays use the lossless
typed-row path until the column-page codec can represent arrays.

The executable boundary contracts cover scalar, cross-join and grouped reads,
ownership after source mutation, allocation-failure cleanup, SQL/JSON NULL
distinction and the public array-output guard. PostgreSQL independently checks
the same scalar/join/grouped values. This is architectural progress, not an
original-case activation: the inventory remains 358 implemented, 136 rejected,
73 superseded and 1,019 unresolved. Common array element-type coercion across
set arms and the generated public/pgwire array descriptors and codecs still
need completion before the remaining array original cases can receive parity
credit.

### Typed internal query results (2026-10-07)

Internal binding now retains array-valued outputs instead of applying public
wire restrictions at every derived-relation boundary. Public binding still
rejects unsupported wire result types before execution. Nested blocking queries,
scalar owners and window input use one typed sink boundary, with either a shared
spill cursor or a bounded no-I/O replay cursor. Sorted results transfer their
operator ownership rather than materializing another JSON result matrix. Scalar
owners keep the two-row cardinality frontier; array-valued min/max capture keeps
its element descriptor as well as its owned value.

External window ingestion no longer rebinds and routes internal input through
the public JSON stream. It retains one bounded typed page for the small-input
fast path and then writes directly into its window row/column store. Memory
window execution releases its input cursor before calculating windows. Deferred
provider output and ordinary selected rows honor typed sinks as well, so neither
path silently drops array payloads.

Executable PostgreSQL contracts cover CTEs, materialization, ordered subqueries,
same-type UNION ALL, array-valued ordered-set aggregates, windows and scalar
subqueries. The engine exercises memory and spill modes, including array values,
NULL elements and allocation-failure cleanup; the mounted HTTP gate checks the
same seven query shapes, complete wire rows, column types and SQL-null flags.
These contracts do not activate unrelated original cases or publish raw arrays.

### Common set and VALUES row types (2026-10-07)

Set binding now retains complete element descriptors and resolves binary
UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT nodes before their parents. Each arm is coerced before
the node compares, hashes or emits it. In particular, an outer float4 widening
cannot collapse two bigint arrays before an inner DISTINCT has run. Numeric
widths, NULL arrays and unknown string literals participate in the same bound
coercion programs; incompatible concrete array types fail with cannot-coerce
rather than silently converting through JSON placeholders.

Standalone VALUES uses the existing bounded flat row-source machinery. VALUES
selects one common type across all rows, not a pairwise set-operation chain.
Literal rows retain their grouped fast path and allocation-free literal type
inspection. Nontrivial coercions use compiled expressions. Both binding and
execution preserve derived/CTE boundaries: unknown results become text inside
their producer and cannot subsequently infer a numeric parameter from an outer
set or assignment. Tests that previously assumed otherwise now use explicit
inner casts, with independent PostgreSQL negatives retaining the original
invalid forms. Bare target-context INSERT parameters remain a separate valid
assignment path.

This advances the internal type architecture, not original-case activation.
Public raw-array and pgwire descriptors/codecs, typed mutation capture and the
broader scalar common-type/overload catalog remain unfinished. The original
inventory remains 358 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 1,019
unresolved until exact-source mounted execution earns additional dispositions.

### Lossless array result codec (2026-10-07)

The shared array wire codec now represents non-NULL arrays as dimensions
(`length`, `lower_bound`), flat row-major values and aligned SQL-null flags.
Element type remains a bound-column descriptor; JSON shape never chooses a SQL
type. Integers use exact canonical decimal strings. Finite floating values use
JSON numbers, while NaN and infinities use explicit tokens instead of collapsing
to JSON null. JSONB null elements and SQL NULL elements remain distinct.

Streaming output validates and admits the complete value before destination
writes, without per-cell serialization buffers. Retained byte output has one
exact-sized allocation. Ordinal JSON output materializes directly without a
stringify/parse round trip, and decode validates before retaining cells, clones
payload ownership and can use a stable quota owner accounting arena capacity.
Both ordinary JSON numeric parsing and exact number-token parsing preserve
dimension metadata. The PostgreSQL text/binary fixtures cover element domains,
bounds and NULL provenance; JSONB comparison is semantic because PostgreSQL's
binary JSONB wrapper contains formatted JSON rather than canonical row bytes.
Malformed shape/type/quota cases reject before cell allocation, and allocation
faults exercise retained byte output, JSON materialization and decoded owners.

A debug streaming workload emitted 262,144 cells / 3,439,056 bytes in about
119 ms with zero encoder allocations. This is an absolute local workload, not
a before/after speedup claim. Public activation is still guarded: generated
column/array OpenAPI contracts, final-output integration, PostgreSQL element OID
and result-codec integration, and transport-level original-case proofs are the
next dependencies. This codec alone earns no original-case disposition credit.

### Array result descriptors and streaming text output (2026-10-07)

OpenAPI now defines the bound array element enum, dimensions and lossless
value envelope. Zig, Go, Python and TypeScript models are generated from that
contract; the Rust SDK's input specification is synchronized. Python and
TypeScript export these models through their public SDK entry points. The
Python SQL tests and TypeScript type tests preserve exact integer strings,
non-default bounds and JSON-null versus SQL-null flags.

Final SELECT, grouped/window, sorted/deferred and mutation-returning paths now
retain complete Datums until the result boundary rather than extracting an
array's JSON-null placeholder. The boundary checks element descriptors and
copies retained envelopes into the result owner. A native regression releases
the source array before inspecting nested JSONB output; mismatched element
descriptors and accidental JSON substitution are rejected.

The PostgreSQL text-array encoder streams dimensions and flat cells through
bounded-depth braces. A writer adapter escapes text and JSONB directly without
per-element serialization buffers or encoder allocations. Whole-value domain,
wire-byte and shared validation/emission work admission happen before output.
Tests round-trip all 19 PostgreSQL reference vectors and independently check
exact emitted escaping, bounds, integer extrema, NaN/infinities, empty arrays,
SQL NULL and JSONB null. PostgreSQL independently decodes the exact emitted
vectors. Byte/work quota rejection leaves the destination untouched; actual
writer failures remain writer failures. The JSON-envelope encoder now also
shares validation and emission work admission rather than budgeting each
phase independently.

Public array results remain deliberately guarded until PostgreSQL column/OID
and result-codec integration and mounted HTTP/pgwire execution evidence are
complete. Array parameters and native stored-array columns still need their
typed ingress/storage contracts; this change does not reinterpret document
JSON arrays as SQL arrays. No original inventory case is credited by these
architecture-only changes.

### Public array result activation (2026-10-07)

Array-valued result columns now cross the typed public boundary with explicit
element descriptors. Pgwire describe, retained execution and streaming metadata
retain that descriptor and advertise its exact PostgreSQL array OID. Both text
and binary DataRow encoders use the descriptor rather than guessing from JSON.
NULL arrays use the ordinary outer NULL framing; empty arrays and JSONB-null
elements remain independently representable.

Prepared/cursor shape checks include element identity, not only column names
and coarse `array` type, preventing an element-OID change across execution or
resumed pages. DataRow admission reserves all remaining cell length headers
and admits each payload against actual remaining frame space. Primitive/JSON
cells preflight their encoded size as well. A two-array row regression proves
individually fitting cells cannot publish an oversized combined frame.

Immediate pgwire encoding validates a borrowed envelope view with two flat
cell/axis buffers. Nested JSONB and text payloads remain pinned to the result
owner instead of being cloned again. Allocation-failure tests unwind either
buffer, and payload-pointer tests establish borrowing. Encoder quota checks
bound the actual PostgreSQL payload independently of the differently sized JSON
envelope, so compact binary arrays do not inherit a JSON-metadata frame limit.
Array parameters still reject without a complete typed input descriptor rather
than silently converting an array expression's JSON-null placeholder.

Native contracts exercise constant, empty, NULL, multidimensional/non-default
bound, JSONB, set/VALUES promotion, window and scalar-subquery outputs with and
without execution I/O. Existing array-rejection tests are now positive value
and ownership assertions, retaining allocation-failure coverage. Ordered-set
percentile arrays also assert exact fractional values and SQL-null flags.
Mounted HTTP contracts exercise generated metadata and envelope decoding; the
authenticated native pgwire adapter exercises describe/execute and both output
codecs. Protocol tests independently inspect RowDescription OIDs and DataRow
lengths/payloads in simple-text and extended-binary sessions, including empty
and NULL arrays. PostgreSQL independently proves the producer result types and
logical values. These are architectural contracts, not additional original-case
disposition credit. Typed array ingress, native stored-array columns and original
source-case reconciliation remain unfinished.

### Exact-source SQL array result reconciliation

The PostgreSQL read oracle now requests binary results and independently
decodes supported SQL array OIDs into the public lossless envelope. It retains
rank, axis lengths, lower bounds, decimal-string integer cells, non-finite float
tokens and separate SQL NULL flags, including JSONB null versus SQL NULL.
Rank, byte and element budgets and complete-frame checks reject malformed or
unsupported contracts instead of silently flattening arrays into JSON lists.
Native reference comparisons check exact element OIDs and typed array values,
with regressions rejecting altered bounds and null provenance.

The unchanged grouped multi-percentile original `sql-0561` now passes mounted
HTTP over native typed storage and the independently reproduced PostgreSQL
golden. All 77 pre-existing read contracts remain unchanged; the selected read
golden contains 78 contracts. Golden extension requires a checked baseline and
fails on existing drift, unknown/duplicate IDs or PostgreSQL rejection.
The inventory records 365 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 1,012
unresolved cases. General array regressions do not create additional original
case credit, and native stored-array columns remain unfinished.

### NULL-aware tuple membership in captured relational execution

`sql/tuple_membership.zig`, exported through the relational operators, provides
the retained lookup kernel for row-valued `IN` and `NOT IN`. Ordinary equality
hash joins cannot implement the required three-valued logic: `(NULL, 1)` is
definitively unequal to `(2, 2)`, but potentially equal to `(2, 1)`. Empty inner
relations are false for `IN`, including an all-NULL left tuple, and `NOT IN`
negates only true/false, retaining UNKNOWN.

A shared-prefix trie hashes edges by parent and typed cell value, checks hash
collisions with typed comparison, and retains one owned payload per distinct
prefix. Exact non-NULL hits use one lookup per column. Ambiguous NULL probes
visit only compatible prefixes using a fixed stack bounded by the admitted
256-column arity. This avoids per-probe allocation, per-outer-row source scans,
JSON key serialization and exponential precomputed NULL-mask tables. Duplicate
right tuples share their complete path. Array keys preserve dimensions, lower
bounds, exact integer values and element NULL flags; JSONB null is a non-NULL
SQL value. The binder establishes per-position common comparison domains and
checks exact arity before opening sources. Array equality requires identical
element types, unlike numeric array promotion in UNION/VALUES; incompatible
operator signatures produce PostgreSQL's undefined-operator diagnostic.

Input-row, retained-byte and cumulative-work admission and cooperative
checkpoints bound build and ambiguous searches. A failed build poisons the
index so partial prefixes cannot become visible as successful rows. Source
payloads are cloned before their page owner retires. Allocation-fault tests
exercise complete cleanup, and deterministic work tests bound 4,096 exact
two-column probes independently of machine timing. PostgreSQL independently
reproduces 1,740 IN/NOT IN truth pairs over 110 right-hand multisets, including
all one/two-column NULL combinations, duplicates, empty sources and selected
three-column sources. Kernel tests alone do not create original-case credit.

Parenthesized and explicit ROW constructors now lower in membership contexts
to a compiler-owned relational operator, not a serialized JSON scalar. Cold
scan projections retain both build and probe keys. Equality-correlated keys
prefix the retained lookup; NULL correlation keys select an empty inner domain,
not the wildcard NULL semantics of tuple comparison. Invariant builds can be
shared across Apply/recursive iterations. Complex correlated projections and
sort/page/group boundaries instead preserve the original child query inside a
demanded LATERAL producer. Separate true and unknown witnesses summarize its
actual output without evaluating expressions in eliminated correlation groups.
Masked branches keep their existing demand and lexical outer-frame bindings.
Scalar membership's existing grouped fast path remains unchanged.

Six original correlated and tuple-membership mutations (`sql-0600`–`sql-0602`,
`sql-0610`–`sql-0612`) execute unchanged through mounted HTTP. Independent
PostgreSQL golden results verify affected counts and complete persisted state
of all source/target tables, with duplicate and SQL NULL witnesses. Each
statement captures one native read set; logical keys are unchanged and no
distributed constraint-owner activation is inferred from these fixtures.

Fourteen complete native query contracts are independently checked against
PostgreSQL, including query boundaries, masked evaluation, array/JSONB keys,
and correlated NULL witnesses. An allocation-failure campaign exercises the
retained Apply build lifecycle. EXPLAIN identifies NULL-aware membership rather
than calling it an ordinary hash join.

Remaining architecture includes spill-backed membership, finer-grained
correlation dependency pruning and partition reuse, broader row/composite
expressions, consistent arity diagnostics through complex derived projections,
and broader mounted read/pgwire coverage. Retained-byte, row and work admission
currently fail closed; this is not an unbounded fallback or a claim that the
entire distributed SQL architecture is complete.

### Typed array search and replacement execution

`array_position`, `array_positions`, `array_remove` and `array_replace` now
share the typed array boundary and follow [PostgreSQL's array-function
contracts](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-array.html). Binding
resolves PostgreSQL's anycompatible
element family separately from exact array-operator identity, inserts explicit
operand coercions, and retains authoritative prepared-input widths. Unknown
literal strings adopt a known element domain; typed incompatible arguments
produce an undefined-function diagnostic rather than an implicit text cast.

Search/removal use IS NOT DISTINCT FROM semantics, including SQL NULL and NaN.
Search results are actual subscripts, not zero-based offsets. Positions results
are one-based int4 arrays; removal preserves the input lower bound unless its
result is empty. Replacement supports all admitted ranks and retains every
dimension and lower bound. One-dimensional-only searches/removal return the
PostgreSQL unsupported-feature diagnostic for multidimensional inputs. A NULL
initial search position is diagnosed for a nonempty one-dimensional array;
NULL and empty arrays return NULL. The start argument requires an int4-compatible
input descriptor rather than an implicit narrowing cast from bigint.

Dynamic lookup is a bounded scan. Constant arrays without a start-position
argument reuse the program-owned typed membership index, including its first
NULL ordinal. Exact-sized positions/removal output vectors use two bounded
passes; replacement uses one pass before typed validation. Result cells borrow
pinned input payloads, and retained operator boundaries continue to clone them
before source retirement. Work and output-byte admission cover execution and
result construction, and allocation-failure tests cover prepared indexes and
transforms. A 10,000-probe debug workload over a retained 16-cell constant array
used zero evaluation scratch bytes and took approximately 10 ms; this is an
absolute measurement, not a before/after speedup claim.

Independent PostgreSQL contracts check complete Boolean semantics, exact array
OIDs, dimensions, bigint payloads, SQL NULL flags and diagnostic codes. Mounted
HTTP checks array envelopes and prepared promotions. These are shared execution
contracts, not original-corpus disposition credit: stored-array schema/read/
mutation activation and the broader array-function catalog remain unfinished.
The original-case inventory remains 365 implemented,
136 rejected, 73 superseded and 1,012 unresolved.

### Shape-aware array concatenation

`array_append`, `array_prepend`, `array_cat` and array-valued `||` overloads
share the compatible-element resolver and explicit typed coercions. Array
operator resolution distinguishes unknown string/NULL operands (array-array
concatenation) from typed scalar operands (append/prepend); text/JSON scalar
concatenation retains its existing path. Prepared-input descriptors retain
their original widths even when the result promotes to a wider element type.

Append/prepend accept empty or one-dimensional arrays and preserve an existing
lower bound. Concatenation admits equal or adjacent ranks: equal-rank operands
must have matching trailing lengths and lower bounds; adjacent-rank operands
must match the complete lower-rank shape to the higher-rank tail. The result
retains the appropriate first-axis lower bound rather than normalizing it to
one. Nonidentity construction allocates one admitted flat element vector and
dimension vector, borrowing pinned payloads until the usual retention boundary.
NULL/empty concatenation identities reuse the existing typed operand without
allocating or copying its vector. Rank/shape errors have PostgreSQL diagnostic
codes, and dimension-growth overflow fails admission before result allocation.

Native contracts cover array/element NULL distinctions, equal/adjacent ranks,
non-default bounds, exact bigint promotion, unknown-string overloads and masked
evaluation. Independent PostgreSQL checks verify these semantics and complete
typed output shapes. Allocation-failure tests cover nested construction and
operator lowering. A prepared identity workload asserts zero evaluation scratch
allocation over 10,000 rows and measured approximately 3.7 ms in a debug build
(an absolute workload measurement, not a before/after speedup claim).
Mounted HTTP contracts check exact envelopes and
cross-width array parameters. This remains shared execution progress, not
additional original-case credit or stored-array activation.

### Declared array schema identity

CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN now retain the declared builtin element
identity in the immutable SQL AST, using the same type parser as casts. The
descriptor distinguishes all nine admitted array element domains, including
int2/int4/int8 and float4/float8, rather than collapsing an array into JSON or a
coarse numeric column. Declared dimension counts and sizes do not constrain
actual PostgreSQL array values and are not retained as type identity.

Native contracts cover sixteen declarations and aliases, CREATE/ALTER descriptor
equivalence, nullability, malformed dimensions, bounded token admission and
every allocation-failure point. Independent PostgreSQL catalog checks compare
exact OIDs and nullability for both DDL forms and verify that empty arrays are
accepted regardless of declared dimensions. This descriptor work did not itself
activate narrow scalar storage; the complete scalar boundary is described below.

This is schema-boundary groundwork, not stored-array activation or additional
original-case credit. Durable schema metadata, physical array cells, native
read/mutation adaptation and canonical backup/restore validation remain to be
connected. CREATE array schemas still fail before publication; ALTER failure
leaves the original schema unchanged. These guards must only be removed after
the complete typed storage path is verified. The inventory remains 365
implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 1,012 unresolved.

### Durable precise SQL type contracts

SQL binding and immutable runtime schemas share one storage-independent builtin
identity definition, retaining the existing scalar/array PostgreSQL OIDs.
Runtime schema format 16 adds an optional precise SQL descriptor per physical
column. Canonical schema equality includes it; serializing a declared type into
an older format fails instead of silently dropping the descriptor. The decoder
preflights descriptor tags, complete structure and physical-type compatibility
before ownership transfers. Schemas without precise declarations retain their
existing SQL admission behavior.

Prepared and ordinary row encoding, strict decode/restore, and projected reads
check declared integer widths, canonical float4 widening, UUID spelling and
SQL text encoding without allocating. A physically valid checksum alone does
not admit an out-of-domain value. Existing native limitations on nonfinite
scalar number cells remain explicit; this does not claim stored PostgreSQL
NaN/infinity support. Index-cover fingerprints and source binding retain the
precise descriptor. Ordered tuple and expression fingerprints also bind their
declared domains, and cold tuple/row source binding rejects an unconverted
domain change even when coarse physical types match. Byte-retaining rewrite
plans refuse descriptor changes
until an explicit typed conversion path exists. Full-text projection identity
does not change merely because this SQL metadata is present.

Deployed format-15 document/relational catalogs remain readable without a write
on open. New schema publication atomically advances the catalog capability to
the runtime schema format; a catalog that advertises only format 15 cannot
authorize a schema carrying precise descriptors. Stored array cells and their
complete typed read/mutation/backup activation remain unfinished. No original-case
dispositions are credited for this infrastructure alone.

### Public scalar SQL domains and canonical preparation

Relational root scalar properties can explicitly declare `x-antfly-sql-type`,
using the OpenAPI-generated `SQLBuiltinType` enum. The native property type must
match its SQL domain. SQL CREATE/ADD COLUMN emits this annotation for known
builtins, and catalog loading retains all nine builtin identities and numeric
widths. Python, TypeScript, Go and Zig models are generated from the public
specification. The Rust SDK specification is synchronized as well.

Existing standard `format` annotations do not acquire new SQL range semantics.
Document tables and nested/composed scalar annotations are rejected rather than
silently losing SQL identity during physical-layout derivation. SQL arrays are
not inferred from JSON array properties. Stored-array DDL remains guarded.

An immutable compiled column plan normalizes owned input before checks, hashes
and index extraction. Integer widths are checked without floating-point
conversion; float4 inputs are rounded once into their canonical widened value;
UUID strings are canonicalized. Numeric strings are not implicitly admitted by
the native JSON write API. CREATE/ALTER defaults use the same precise widths,
and an invalid replacement default leaves the original schema intact. Stored
expressions convert into their target domain before dependent expressions run;
restore evaluates the same conversions to verify generated results. Output-only
generated fields do not validate caller-supplied replacement values.

Restore verifies rather than repairs scalar values. JSONB string/key validation
shares the bounded, allocation-free text-domain walk used by typed arrays,
including field-local restore checks. Ordinary schema updates cannot reinterpret
a retained column under another SQL domain; explicit typed conversion remains
required and is not yet implemented. Native nonfinite scalar-number storage is
still unsupported, and this work does not claim complete PostgreSQL JSONB
numeric-domain parity.

Native contracts cover public-schema validation, canonical preparation, generated
dependencies, allocation failures, canonical semantic hashes/row bytes, LSM
reopen and mixed-batch atomicity. PostgreSQL independently verifies the native
scalar fixture's exact float4 value, catalog OIDs, integer/float range errors and
text NUL rejection. The mixed-schema allocation-failure sweep forces the backing
allocator's allocate/copy growth path, so optional in-place arena resizing cannot
change the number of fault points between trials; every growth allocation remains
faulted and leak-checked. These are shared architecture contracts, not new
original-case credits: 365 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 1,012
unresolved remain the authoritative inventory.

### Compact schema-bound array codec groundwork

A borrowed, allocation-free directory now addresses flat typed array payloads
using schema-owned element identity, dimensions/lower bounds, a NULL bitmap and
fixed-width slots or variable-width offsets. NULL-heavy primitive arrays use
non-NULL slots with rank checkpoints every 64 cells; lookup remains constant
time. Header-only shape projection reads O(rank) metadata from already
authenticated rows. Untrusted publication requires full structural and canonical
validation, including bounded semantic JSONB checks; shape projection alone is
not a restore gate.

Primitive preparation allocates nothing and encoding makes one exact output
allocation. JSONB canonicalizes each element once during preparation; strict
validation reuses bounded scratch storage and rejects, rather than repairs,
noncanonical input. Allocation-failure tests also exposed and fixed the shared
JSON memory writer's `WriteFailed` mapping: buffer exhaustion now propagates as
`OutOfMemory`, allowing quota and injected-failure handling to remain accurate.

Tests cover eleven PostgreSQL binary fixtures across all nine element types,
multidimensional/nondefault bounds, SQL NULL versus JSONB null, exact bigint and
floating-point representations, 135 dense/compact boundary cohorts, malformed
directories, truncated frames, budgets and exhaustive allocation failures. A
4,096-cell fixture with one eighth NULL occupies 4,372 bytes for boolean, 7,956
for int16 and 29,460 for int64, versus PostgreSQL wire sizes of 19,988, 23,572 and
45,076 bytes respectively. These are codec byte/allocation measurements, not an
end-to-end storage latency claim.

This codec is not yet a published native column format. Native schema capability
activation, row preparation/materialization, semantic hashing, index semantics
and restore integration remain required before stored-array DDL can be enabled.
No original SQL case receives new implementation credit from this groundwork.

### Native typed-array row boundary

Native schemas now distinguish `sql_array` from JSON, blobs and dense vectors.
ASCH 17 binds the mandatory precise element identity to the immutable column.
Format 15/16 catalogs and deployed scalar schemas remain readable without an
upgrade write on open; an older capability cannot authorize an array layout,
and serialization refuses a downgrade that would lose the array contract.
Document-mode layouts and JSON-backed array declarations are rejected.

Native preparation borrows the existing parsed envelope while producing one
canonical flat payload. Packed and cold-column cells retain element identity;
logical reconstruction uses the lossless dimensions/values/SQL-NULL envelope.
Semantic hashing includes typed elements, shape, lower bounds and SQL NULLs,
not offsets, padding, frame flags or the dense/compact representation. Physical
floating zero signs survive storage while their semantic hashes agree.

Strict restore checks complete array canonicality, including JSONB semantics,
even when a noncanonical row has a valid physical checksum. Already admitted,
authenticated rows instead inspect only addressing extents for targeted reads;
shape projection and primitive cell lookup require no flat cell materialization.

Stored-array public schema declarations are active; SQL DDL activation and SQL
scan/mutation adapters remain unfinished. Array ordered/unique/FK index keys
remain explicitly guarded
until typed ordering is implemented; arrays are not silently indexed as blobs.
These native contracts do not change the original-case disposition counts.

Owned JSON numeric values use one exact IEEE-754-to-decimal kernel for ordering,
hashing and canonical persistence, avoiding shortest-print rounding after logical
identity has already been established. Parsed JSONB retains decimal tokens;
this internal consistency contract does not redefine SQL float-to-JSONB casts.
Independent Python decimal and PostgreSQL JSONB checks verify the explicit
numeric fixtures. Native tests also cover subnormal and maximum finite values.

Verification: 406 embedded and 175 hosted SQL tests; 154 embedded and one hosted
native relational-system test; 101 PostgreSQL oracle tests. Native preparation
and reconstruction unwind every injected allocation failure for all eleven
binary array fixtures. The debug trusted-projection fixture performs 10,000
lookups in approximately 3.7 ms for 4,096 cells and 3.6 ms for 65,536 cells,
materializing no cell vector. These are local code-path measurements, not an
end-to-end distributed latency guarantee.

### Parsed SQL-array admission boundary

The envelope validator is shared by owned and borrowed decoding and by
allocation-free validation of an already parsed API value. It reports the same
work and wire-byte admission as materialization, without constructing flat cell
or dimension buffers. Admission results are accounting, not transferable trust
tokens: each consumer still validates its current input.

In-place normalization validates the complete envelope before changing any
cell, then rounds finite float4 values in the existing DOM. Integer decimal
strings, dimensions, lower bounds, SQL NULL flags, JSONB values and nonfinite
float spellings remain unchanged. Preservation mode rejects float4 values that
would round; both failed admission and a late invalid cell leave the input
unchanged. This is the reusable boundary needed for public schema preparation
to make extraction and physical storage agree without extra vectors or JSON
parsing. SQL DDL and SQL scan/mutation activation remain unfinished;
this change does not reclassify any original parity case.

The local debug admission benchmark takes approximately 7 ms for four passes
over 4,096 cells and 126 ms for four passes over 65,536 cells, with no retained
cell vector or allocation in validation. Maximum-cardinality measurement uses
an explicit 8 MiB work budget; the default 1 MiB work limit still rejects this
larger envelope. Cardinality, bytes and work remain independent safeguards.

Verification: 409 embedded and 175 hosted SQL tests, seven targeted native
array/reopen/restore tests, 101 PostgreSQL oracle tests and 20 inventory verifier
tests. The original inventory remains 365 implemented, 136 rejected,
73 superseded and 1,012 unresolved.

### Public typed-array column schemas

Relational root properties can declare `{"type":"sql_array",
"x-antfly-sql-type":"int64","nullable":true}`. All nine builtin element
identities bind to ASCH 17 typed-array columns, never JSON columns. Missing
identity, implicit JSON-array conversion, nested annotations and document-mode
declarations are rejected. Generated `SQLArrayColumnSchema` and `SQLBuiltinType`
contracts are available through public Python, TypeScript and Go SDK exports;
the Rust SDK builds them from its synchronized public specification.

Compiled preparation normalizes the existing parsed envelope before extraction
and physical encoding. Its owned admission path discharges the subsequent
array-domain walk, while ordinary schema constraints still run against the
canonical envelope. No extra flat cell vector or JSON parsing is needed for
schema preparation. Admission is bound in O(1) to the exact immutable parsed
schema owner, version and storage mode; a different compiled plan is rejected
before normalization can mutate input. Public validation and field-local
restore cannot assert
that a value was admitted; restore retains strict physical validation and
canonical float4 verification.

The native public-schema fixture covers batch atomicity, exact bigint strings,
non-default lower bounds, JSONB-null/SQL-NULL element provenance, float4 coercion,
LSM reopen and portable restore with the public schema retained. Schema changes
cannot reinterpret retained array elements. Envelope schema constraints and
exhaustive allocation failures are covered independently. These native storage
and SDK contracts do not activate SQL DDL, SQL execution adapters or array
index keys, and do not change any original parity-case disposition.

Verification: 159 embedded and one hosted native relational-system tests;
409 embedded and 175 hosted SQL tests; 101 PostgreSQL oracle tests;
24 Python and 72 TypeScript SDK tests; Go SDK and generated-client package
tests; TypeScript type checking; Rust SDK compilation; OpenAPI and Python
generation checks. Inventory remains 365 implemented, 136 rejected,
73 superseded and 1,012 unresolved.

Remote publication metadata now reuses owned decoded-cache leases for inventories,
file maps, declaration directories, and native ordered/text/vector roots. Current
coverage, authorization, and reader fences still precede consumption. Remote native
chunk loading uses per-chunk single-flight admission and bounded successor prefetch;
cache mutexes protect bookkeeping rather than network calls. See
[remote serving ownership and GC](../zig/REMOTE_TABLE_SERVING.md#bounded-publication-reuse-and-collection-progress)
for the durable collection frontier, replacement admission, and shared mapping
accounting contracts.


Variable-width MIN/MAX batch admission includes retained input payloads before
mutating group state, routing oversized cohorts through ordered spill admission.
Remote immutable snapshot coverage proofs reuse canonical data hashing while
refreshing delete evidence. Text corpus limits count unique physical segments
across active generations, with sealed reader composition across overlapping
roots. GC batches verified live-set probes and uses durable filesystem upload
journal offsets; remote providers retain exclusive lexical continuations.


Native lake scan and aggregate ownership refinements are specified in
[REMOTE_TABLE_SERVING.md](../zig/REMOTE_TABLE_SERVING.md#immutable-scan-plans-and-aggregate-reduction-trees).
The maintained contracts include transparent statement cursor capabilities,
immutable snapshot plans with sparse version overlays, mixed algebraic/search
delta replay, exact radix reduction trees, protocol-25 paged contribution records,
and independently completing GC audit censuses. The regression tests enforce
unchanged-file read rejection during mixed-index appends and aggregate append/
removal, subtree reference reuse, immutable manifest retention and split lifetime.

Native lake refinements use reader/topology protocol 26 for keyed contribution
pages and group-key-partitioned aggregate roots. The source, recipe, lease,
spilling, GC, and compatibility contracts are documented in
[Remote table serving](../zig/REMOTE_TABLE_SERVING.md#keyed-contribution-state-grouped-partitions-and-cold-load-admission).

### Typed MERGE and shared columnar ownership

MERGE full-scan, identity-point and ordered-index candidates now share a
bounded typed capture with independent replay readers. Classification, lazy
assignment pages and RETURNING retain complete array values and element
identities. Keys, storage images and DELETE preimages become owned only at
their retention boundary; candidate readers close before writer admission.
Source-only inserts carry the native unique-absence fence, and normalization
cannot change absence or conflict guards. Optional strategy binding may decline
an unsupported shape, but cannot swallow cancellation or backend failures.

The remote-lake integration preserves leased columnar result pages alongside
typed replay and borrowed sorted traversal. Resident array leases retain their
cursor without copying payloads; sorted rows cannot retire under a lease or a
sealed replay reader. Typed partial aggregate values use the shared portable
block codec. Plain grouped results retain main's columnar batches, while ordered
aggregates use their bounded collector and invocation constants remain visible
in both paths. Native relation column readers can carry arrays directly rather
than forcing an intermediate per-row adapter.

Partition builds consult live shared-budget headroom so input decode, enclosing
operators and output delivery do not each spend the original statement ceiling.
The unchanged small-budget spill/join workload remains an integration gate.
Allocation-failure, per-checkpoint cancellation, guard tampering, index
saturation/readiness fallback, source-only inserts and resident lease/replay
tests cover these boundaries. This is implementation and component evidence,
not a claim that the remaining original SQL parity cases are complete.

### Stored typed-array reads and text output

Fourteen original cases now have strict native/PostgreSQL evidence. The ledger
contains 379 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 998 unresolved cases;
the original 1,586-case inventory is unchanged.

The PostgreSQL oracle has a separate `typed_array_read` profile: ordinary JSON
arrays remain JSONB, while explicitly declared SQL arrays retain element type,
dimensions, non-default lower bounds, whole-value NULLs and element NULLs. The
campaign executes fourteen unchanged original queries against native storage
through HTTP. Scalar fixtures separately cover all nine builtin element domains,
multidimensional string output, JSONB numeric scale and exact bigint values.
Mutation readback for this profile remains guarded until it has an equally
lossless array codec; Python list conversion is not accepted as evidence.

Array overlap uses the shared typed membership index. Either constant operand
can be prepared once; dynamic evaluation indexes the smaller operand. The
10,000-row debug workload completed in approximately 12 ms without hot-loop
allocations. `array_to_string` counts output bytes before retaining its single
exact-sized output allocation. The 32,768-element primitive workload produced
98,303 bytes in approximately 2.8 ms with one allocation. These are local debug
measurements, not production throughput claims.

Column projection and result delivery retain complete Datums rather than their
JSON-null placeholders. Arrays become envelopes only at the public boundary;
fallback wire cells re-enter typed execution using their declared element type.
Leased/native and public-page regressions exercise non-default bounds, NULL
elements, exact bigint values and allocation failures. This does not activate
array DDL, array index keys, or the unfinished broader SQL architecture.

### Joined mutation source-aware RETURNING

Joined UPDATE/DELETE RETURNING now binds against the complete authorized join
scope, sharing wildcard, ambiguity and typed-program binding with MERGE. Its
execution slots are dense: a 128-column unused source tail does not widen a
two-cell RETURNING frame. Only required source cells enter the shared bounded,
spill-capable capture. DELETE preimages likewise retain only required target
fields. Source types remain independent of assignment coercion: copying a
smallint array into a bigint target does not change the source RETURNING type.

Joined selection streams into a target-keyed mutation collector. Match fanout
retains one coherent source representative per target before mutation-row
admission, rather than materializing every joined match or grouping independent
source columns into incompatible representatives. All target images undergo
native preparation, then RETURNING evaluates against the normalized/defaulted/
generated target and captured source. Key, version, digest, absence, conflict and
predicate guards must survive normalization. Typed readers and physical read
owners close before writer admission; errors in RETURNING cannot publish writes.

The existing 1,024-target/source debug workload retains one physical capture and
2,048 native input rows. Its observed peak statement memory decreased from
4,632,337 to 4,432,621 bytes after streaming collection and reclaimable metadata
growth; debug latency remained approximately 120 ms. These local samples are
not a production throughput claim. Component regressions exercise source/target
array domains and NULL provenance, generated/defaulted images, qualified stars,
parameters, 256-fold DELETE fanout under a one-row mutation limit, allocation
faults, cancellation, shared disk capture replay and normalization guard
tampering. Shared unchanged query fixtures are independently verified against
PostgreSQL. Type inference and dependency-pruned rebinding reuse each authorized
source catalog identity, preventing schema-epoch drift within a statement.

UPDATE FROM and DELETE USING select one coherent matched source row per target
before affected-row admission, rather than rejecting PostgreSQL's legal UPDATE
fanout or returning columns from different matches. This does not promise which
matching row is chosen; MERGE retains its independent cardinality contract.
Source-aware RETURNING subqueries use the ordinary relational planner over a
compiler-owned prepared input. Its lexical scope retains the original target
and source qualifiers; dependency analysis prunes that input before capture.
Target fields come from normalized native images and source fields from the
same coherent joined representative, with typed, spill-capable replay. Child
physical scans join the mutation's single statement capture, never a new
post-write snapshot. RETURNING errors and cancellation precede publication.
The shared PostgreSQL oracle verifies nine scalar statements plus typed-array
correlation, including CTE/derived sources, dead branches and empty scalar
results. Native component tests additionally cover every allocation failure and
checkpoint cancellation, normalization guard tampering, generated postimages,
shared parameters, zero-width prepared rows, fanout and disk-backed replay.
With 128 cold source columns, 128/512/1,024 targets read exactly 384/1,536/3,072
physical rows through one capture. Checkpoints were 2,280/8,906/17,739 and peak
statement bytes 4,946,138/7,131,447/8,489,103 in the local debug fixture. These
measure bounded scan/planner work, not production latency or throughput.
The complete SQL build passes 509 local-owner tests and 219 server-owner tests
(three existing benchmark skips), and all 102 PostgreSQL oracle regressions
pass. The pull-stream allocation-fault regression uses the shared stable
allocate/copy/free harness so address-dependent remap decisions cannot change
the enumerated allocation count; injected failures and leak checks remain active.
Original-case evidence is still required: no original corpus disposition is
credited solely for these component fixtures.

### Constraint-equivalent native mutation evidence

Thirteen additional original mutation cases now have mounted native/PostgreSQL
evidence: 426 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 951 unresolved, with
the original 1,586-case inventory unchanged. Recursive cases remain unresolved
until their original fixture exercises a nontrivial recursive step.

The native campaign derives logical primary keys from the PostgreSQL profile
through the production DDL builder. Fresh databases bootstrap real enforced
activation; complete owner ranges let admission verify native coverage rather
than accepting a fabricated readiness envelope. Seed and reset writes use the
integrity planner and native atomic transactions, so resetting rows also retires
their unique claims. Duplicate and NULL keys fail with PostgreSQL SQLSTATEs
23505 and 23502, without changing the captured primary rows. Exact-source
mutations verify complete RETURNING results and all three tables' persisted
state. These isolated owner fixtures do not prove distributed read cuts or
multi-owner activation.

The stronger profile exposed a primary-key DDL lifetime bug: inserting required
columns can move the parent schema object's slots. Lowering now borrows the
nested properties map independently, without new allocations. Composite-key
growth and allocation-failure regressions are selected by the SQL test gate.
The complete gate passes 510 local-owner and 219 server-owner tests, with three
existing opt-in benchmark skips; the mounted mutation campaign also passes.

### Durable DDL expression schema identities

Check, expression-index, partial-index and ALTER DEFAULT binding now share a
declared-schema column decoder. It validates catalog structure before access,
handles nullable type unions, and retains builtin scalar widths and SQL-array
element identities. An unrelated typed-array column no longer prevents a
scalar check or expression key from binding. Native schema admission tests
exercise checks, a partial expression index, exact smallint defaults, SQL NULL,
and a cold bigint array with non-default bounds and NULL elements.

Durable numeric programs retain builtin widths on literals, arithmetic and
checked casts, including explicit operand promotions. Narrow integer overflow
and float4 rounding therefore survive schema persistence rather than silently
using int64/float64 semantics. Numeric defaults retain assignment-cast plans:
an out-of-range integer default is accepted at DDL time and raises when used,
without preventing an explicit valid value from being written. These programs
require schema capability 18, including after reopen and portable restoration.
Shared numeric fixtures compare native evaluation with PostgreSQL, using binary
float4 results to avoid shortest-text conversion artifacts.

Array-dependent durable expressions, exact decimal assignment semantics,
temporal operations and special floating-point domains remain architecture
gaps. No original-case dispositions are changed by these component regressions.

Durable conditional programs use an ordered `case_when` node, not eager
evaluation or duplicated boolean rewrites. It evaluates each condition once,
treats UNKNOWN as not TRUE, and evaluates only the selected result (or the
mandatory fallback). SQL lowering supplies a typed NULL fallback when ELSE is
omitted and explicitly promotes numeric CASE and COALESCE results to their
bound common domain. The durable VM admits at most fifteen branches, within
the existing node, depth and per-row byte budgets. Conditional programs also
require schema capability 18, even when their results are nonnumeric.
The shared thirty-two-expression PostgreSQL/native fixture covers searched and
simple CASE, typed NULL fallback, branch-local overflow, unselected division by
zero, mixed-width COALESCE, and float4-to-float8 selection. Fault probes cover
preparation ownership; a 10,000-row local debug sample took approximately 1.97 ms
with a failing allocator proving zero per-row scratch allocations. This is a
component latency sample, not a production throughput claim. Native admission
also exercises conditional checks and expression indexes through atomic batch
failure, LSM reopen and portable restore.

Durable predicate programs now retain bounded `IN`/`NOT IN` membership and
integer remainder. Membership evaluates the probe once, observes candidate
errors even for a NULL probe, and lets an equality witness override earlier
NULL candidates. Numeric operands retain their bound promotions and checked
arithmetic before comparison. Integer remainder preserves the dividend's sign
and returns zero for minInt modulo -1, unlike division overflow. Exact decimal
and floating remainder are not approximated by binary-float durable programs.
Boolean truth tests lower to the existing null-safe comparison operations;
UNKNOWN is never silently treated as FALSE.

Membership and remainder require schema capability 19, including string-only
membership programs without numeric type annotations. Generated public enums
come from OpenAPI. Original inventory dispositions remain unchanged until
exact-source native/PostgreSQL campaigns establish complete case evidence.

The focused `zig build antfly-schema-expression-test` gate executes all twenty
durable declaration tests, including the shared sixty-five-expression fixture
through both query and durable evaluators. PostgreSQL independently checks the
same fixture and the membership/remainder DDL with atomic CHECK failures.
The 165-test relational index system gate covers expression-index publication,
covering projection, LSM reopen, portable restore and capability guards.
A local debug membership/remainder sample evaluated 10,000 rows in about
5.4 ms with a failing allocator proving zero per-row scratch allocations;
this excludes preparation, storage and network work.

Durable text-to-numeric casts and exact decimal operations remain unsupported;
these new probes use exact builtin integer operands rather than claiming those
domains. General partial-index predicates still require richer implication and
durable predicate representation beyond the existing conjunctive contract.

The complete SQL run passed 509 local-owner tests (three opt-in benchmark skips).
Its server binary independently passed all 213 tests. The build invocation still
fails its declared 384 MiB process RSS bound, reporting about 1.04 GB; the
statement admission tests do not establish a bound on the entire test process.
This remains a validation-gate issue, not a green full-build result, and the
process limit has not been raised to hide it. The follow-up below addresses
the diagnostic allocation lifetime behind this observation.

### SQL diagnostic memory ownership

The SQL server owner now uses the same exact-filter runner as extracted source
owners. Anonymous reachability anchors remain compiled rather than treated as
runtime behavior evidence. The complete SQL build passes 509 local-owner tests
and 212 server-owner tests, with three existing opt-in benchmark skips.

Zig 0.17's default debug allocator is a process-lifetime arena. SafeAllocator
and allocation-failure enumeration capture many stacks; temporary DWARF unwind
VM buffers are freed by the unwinder but retained by that arena. The shared
test runner now supplies an independent reclaiming debug allocator: libc when
linked, otherwise the native concurrent allocator or the platform's
single-thread/WASM fallback. Persistent symbol caches remain process-owned;
temporary unwind buffers can be reused. Debug allocation never borrows the
test allocator, whose teardown itself can emit diagnostics. Stack traces,
allocation-failure enumeration and leak checks remain enabled.

A matched local debug run of the unchanged exhaustive grouped-output fault
test reduced maximum RSS from 115,916,800 to 9,748,480 bytes (about 92%).
Elapsed time was approximately 13.5 seconds for both runs, so this is a memory
ownership improvement, not an end-to-end latency claim. Runner regressions
verify that the override is active, repeated stack capture produces frames,
and assertion/leak failures still fail with source diagnostics. Original SQL
inventory dispositions remain unchanged by this infrastructure fix.
The complete 212-test server shard subsequently passed with maximum RSS of
17,252,352 bytes (about 16.5 MiB), below the unchanged 384 MiB build estimate;
its local debug runtime was approximately 123 seconds. All twelve shared
runner selection/progress/diagnostic regressions pass as well.

### Owner-masked conflict defaults

`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET column = DEFAULT` now retains an explicit default
assignment through parsing and binding. The conflict operator omits that field
from the selected replacement image; the shared native preparation pipeline
evaluates its declared default (or implicit SQL NULL) and recomputes generated
columns. It does not substitute NULL for a declared default, eagerly prepare
unselected updates, or reuse the proposed INSERT value. Generated columns accept
DEFAULT but not ordinary assignment. Existing old/excluded expressions retain
simultaneous-assignment semantics.

Dense bound target ordinals replace per-row assignment-name scans in both scalar
and decision-batched conflict execution. Defaults remain behind owner selection
and the DO UPDATE predicate in both paths. Component regressions cover new-row
inserts, false predicates and their fences, generated columns, explicit NULL,
default/provider failures before commit, and exhaustive allocation failures.
A PostgreSQL 18 sequence-backed oracle independently checks evaluation timing,
postimages and error atomicity. These component tests do not credit unrelated
original corpus cases. The expanded mounted mutation campaign has reached the
still-unsupported regexp substring/count case; broader regex and named-constraint
arbiters remain follow-up work, and the corpus dispositions are unchanged.

### Named conflict arbiters

`ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT` now retains the exact folded or quoted constraint
name through the SQL catalog, pgwire authorization wrapper and embedded/public
native adapters. Request-owned catalog descriptors distinguish UNIQUE/primary
constraints from CHECK/FK constraints and unrelated access indexes. The native
integrity planner independently binds the selected name to one durable unique
generation, preserving schema fences, all-owner coverage, staged writes and
guarded owner claims. It does not widen a named target to equivalent or unrelated
unique constraints; final mutation validation still enforces every constraint.

Absent names fail with 42704 and CHECK/FK names with 42809 before proposed row
evaluation. PostgreSQL rejects deferrable arbiters later, after proposed defaults;
the native owner-resolution path preserves that timing and returns 55000 without
publishing writes. PostgreSQL 18 sequence-backed tests verify these distinctions.
Composite named arbitration is exercised through real embedded native storage,
including an equivalent deferrable constraint, a nonselected unique violation,
cold reopen and a raced absence guard. Allocation-fault tests retain exact name
ownership across schema-cache eviction and prohibit partially committed writes.

Mounted original-case probes compare affected counts, RETURNING types/NULLs and
complete three-table native postimages with independently regenerated PostgreSQL
goldens. Regex operations, renamed-constraint DDL, alternate archive layouts and
recursive-arm execution remain separate gaps; generic fixture success does not
prove those original contracts.

Six newly verified original cases (sql-1390, sql-1392, sql-1393, sql-1439,
sql-1463 and sql-1465) bring the inventory to 432 implemented, 136 rejected,
73 superseded and 945 unresolved. The absent-name original sql-1487 remains a
verified rejection, now at catalog binding with 42704 rather than a parser error.

Validation: the complete SQL gate passed 510 local and 226 server tests with
three existing opt-in skips and zero leaks. The selected mounted API gate passed
all three tests, the native embedded gate passed both arbitration/reopen tests,
all 105 PostgreSQL oracle tests passed, and a fresh database reproduced all 48
mutation goldens. Inventory integrity and all 20 checker regressions passed.
The broader in-progress mutation probe still fails at unsupported regex; it is
not included in these green-gate claims or credited as completed coverage.

### PostgreSQL regex backend foundation (not activated)

The SQL regex gap now has a separate PostgreSQL ARE backend under
`zig/lib/sql_regex`, rather than adapting the search-index byte automaton or
restarting a matcher at each possible byte offset. The upstream engine is pinned
and licensed; its portability layer owns bounded native allocations, explicit
C collation, per-compilation character-class caching and independent execution
scratch. Searches use a once-decoded Unicode subject and retain its original
anchor/lookbehind domain. Pattern ownership never retains a request budget.

The new `zig build sql-regex-test` gate exercises captures, match precedence,
Unicode spans, empty matches, anchors, lookaround, backreferences, flags, memory
refusal, cancellation, exhaustive allocation failures, nested native calls and
shared patterns across `std.Io` workers. An independently regenerated PostgreSQL
18 C-collation fixture checks 22 exact span/capture contracts. Cached character
transitions consume work, and a fourfold regular-search input increase remains
within a fivefold work bound in the regression fixture.

This is an architectural foundation, not completed public SQL regex support.
Non-libc/WASM portability, reusable execution scratch, complete complex-path
work charging, prepared/dynamic pattern admission, global replacement/iteration,
SQL NULL/error contracts and mounted original cases remain unfinished. Other
collations must be explicitly implemented rather than inheriting host locale.
The corpus counts remain 432 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded /
945 unresolved; no regex case is credited by these backend tests.

The native backend gate passes nine tests (about 0.6 seconds / 7 MiB maximum RSS
in a local Debug run); this is gate runtime, not SQL query latency. The isolated
backend also cross-compiles its tests for x86_64 Linux GNU without executing
them. All 22 PostgreSQL span goldens reproduce from a fresh disposable database.

The next backend increment removes host libc and validates all 22 span plus ten
global-occurrence contracts in import-free freestanding WASM, twice per instance.
Matching now has execution-owned reusable scratch with size-class admission
counting both live and cached physical bytes. Warm repeated matches make no
additional native allocations; varying sizes reclaim idle bins rather than
exceeding the memory bound. Errors clear borrowed budgets and all live scratch
before retry. Global iteration retains the whole Unicode subject and advances
empty matches by one codepoint, including exactly one terminal empty match.
PostgreSQL independently supplies all 26 expected occurrences/capture spans.
The root backend gate now passes 12 tests (about 0.6 seconds / 8 MiB RSS locally),
Linux cross-compilation succeeds, and both fixtures reproduce in fresh disposable
PostgreSQL databases. These measurements are not public SQL latency claims.

Public SQL activation, pattern admission, complete complex-path work charging,
replacement expansion, non-C collations and original corpus probes remain open;
this backend progress does not change the authoritative corpus counts.

The subsequent backend increment adds owned immutable replacement plans and
bounded streaming expansion, including PostgreSQL capture/escape semantics,
global empty matches, occurrence selection and Unicode start offsets. Sixteen
new results are generated by PostgreSQL rather than a second regex library.
The freestanding WASM gate now executes all 48 PostgreSQL contracts twice.
DFA state/arc traversal, cache comparisons, eviction chains and backreference
lengths now consume work; the compile-time heapsort also cancels within sorting,
and every caller aborts rather than using partially sorted arcs. Exhaustive
checkpoint cancellation and allocation-fault tests cover compile, match and
replacement cleanup, including executor reuse after errors. Public SQL binding,
pattern cache admission, the full accounting audit and original mounted corpus
probes are still required; these backend contracts do not earn corpus credits.

Execution-owned regex sessions now provide a bounded eight-entry LRU, owning
pattern keys and flag identity and reserving full compile headroom before cache
admission. A 1,000-row warm fixture compiles once with no additional native
scratch allocations; native fault tests cover admission/cleanup, and the WASM
oracle exercises session reuse. Thirteen additional PostgreSQL ordered-flag
contracts bring the import-free WASM oracle to 61 contracts. The dedicated
backend module is wired through native SQL/storage owners and browser imports,
without changing the search-index matcher. Public scalar binding and the actual
statement/cursor session-owner integration remain unfinished, so the corpus
ledger is still 432 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded / 945 unresolved.

### PostgreSQL escape-string lexical contracts

The shared SQL lexer now decodes explicit `E'...'` literals once during
preparation, including byte escapes, Unicode scalar values and surrogate pairs.
Ordinary strings retain standard-conforming backslashes. Newline continuation
retains the first literal's escape mode and permits whitespace/line comments,
not block comments. Source spans include the full spelling; token quotas apply
before decoding, and continuation trivia still validates UTF-8.

A disposable PostgreSQL 18 oracle supplies 38 values and SQLSTATE contracts.
Malformed Unicode escapes, invalid codepoints and invalid decoded UTF-8/zero
bytes retain distinct 22025/42601/22021 diagnostics through SQL compilation.
The complete standalone lexer gate passes 22 tests, including allocation faults.
This unblocks the capture-replacement expression in the unchanged 48-case
in-progress scalar regex oracle. Statement/cursor session ownership and mounted
original-case postimages remain required before claiming public regex completion
or changing the authoritative corpus ledger.

### Execution-owned PostgreSQL regex scalar activation

The public scalar binder now implements PostgreSQL's text/int4 overloads of
`regexp_like`, `regexp_count`, `regexp_instr`, `regexp_substr` and
`regexp_replace`, preserving strict NULLs, lazy branches, Unicode character
positions, capture selection and ordered flags. A disposable PostgreSQL 18
oracle independently verifies 48 scalar values, result OIDs and SQLSTATEs.

Statements and pull cursors own bounded matcher-lane pools, including through
derived-source lowering and decision evaluation. Immutable prepared plans never
own mutable native scratch. Lanes execute independently; native work does not
hold the pool bookkeeping lock. Actual allocations across all retained lanes
share the statement quota, including cache keys and metadata. Native callbacks
check request cancellation/deadlines synchronously without yielding. Every work
unit is charged, with callback polling amortized over 256 charged units.

Each lane caches regex programs and immutable replacement templates separately.
Replacement admission cannot evict a currently borrowed program; large templates
use a bounded caller-owned fallback rather than becoming unsupported. Pattern
admission reserves full compilation headroom. Templates are bounded to eight
entries and at most 256 KiB or one eighth of the lane cache budget. Allocation
failures, cancellation and cursor close release all ownership.

The 1,000-row pull-cursor regression exercises three regex projections across
released 29-row pages: one pattern compilation, 2,999 pattern hits, one
replacement preparation and 999 template hits, within a 1 MiB statement budget.
This is deterministic preparation/allocation evidence, not a wall-clock latency
claim. Native cache/fallback/churn/fault tests and import-free WASM oracles cover
the shared backend. Original-case credit requires mounted mutation postimage
verification. The mounted gate now verifies five unchanged
original conflict cases (sql-1443, sql-1471, sql-1473, sql-1474 and sql-1475),
including complete RETURNING values and all-table native postimages. Together
with a freshly reproduced 48-case PostgreSQL mutation golden, these bring the
ledger to 437 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded / 940 unresolved.
Historical UPDATE ... FOR UPDATE regex cases are invalid PostgreSQL syntax;
they are not rewritten, silently excluded from an existing golden, or credited.
Non-C collation support and the complete native
complex-path work-accounting audit remain separate unfinished requirements.

The next native hardening increment explicitly charges greedy/shortest repetition
backtracking and verification, capture-vector initialization, final DFA scans and
reallocation copies. Recursive capture clearing now independently checks stack
depth and work, and its callers propagate failure before further dissection.
Repetition failures free their endpoint arrays; a refused realloc leaves its old
allocation intact and retryable. Allocation stops after sticky work/cancellation
failure without compromising cleanup initialization.

Two new independent PostgreSQL capture-span fixtures preserve greedy and shortest
backreference behavior. The native gate passes 23 tests, including cancellation
at every observed compile/match/replacement checkpoint for both patterns and
direct realloc-refusal/retry ownership checks. The import-free WASM gate passes
63 PostgreSQL contracts twice. These safety regressions grant no additional
original-case credit: the corpus remains 437 implemented / 136 rejected /
73 superseded / 940 unresolved. The broader native work-accounting audit remains
open rather than being inferred complete from these representative patterns.

Row-based aggregate predicates and ordinary UPDATE/DELETE predicates now use
the same limits-aware bound predicate evaluator as other statement execution.
The fallback row path retains the statement-owned regex pool and native
cancellation/deadline callback instead of constructing a standalone regex
session for every row. SQL NULL filtering, boolean type checks and typed
invocation admission remain shared and unchanged.

Three 1,000-row row-only provider regressions (aggregate, UPDATE and DELETE)
each require one compilation, 999 cache hits and zero active leases on return.
Native-only cancellation must abort before mutation admission; a clean retry
reuses the owner correctly. Exhaustive allocation-failure checks cover all
three paths. This is deterministic preparation/ownership evidence, not a
wall-clock benchmark or additional original-case credit. The ledger remains
437 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded / 940 unresolved.

A dedicated original aggregate campaign now has nine independent native rows
with escaped-pattern matches, no matches, repeated/distinct uppercase captures,
multiple digit groups, multibyte text, empty text and omitted SQL NULL fields.
Twelve unchanged original SELECTs compare complete public results, PostgreSQL
type OIDs and SQL NULL flags against a fresh PostgreSQL 18 C/UTF-8 oracle.
Grouped-count observers expose the full sort-key peer frontier; the source
queries still execute unchanged, and only genuinely tied output order is free.
The regex original returns digit-group sum 6, character-offset sum 9 and four
distinct non-NULL captures; UTF-8 length aggregates return 44 bytes and 352 bits.
The always-false FILTER retains all three groups with zero counts.

Eleven previously unresolved originals (sql-1225, sql-1232, sql-1242 through
sql-1248, sql-1250 and sql-1251) now have both mounted and PostgreSQL evidence
gates. sql-1252 gains stronger PostgreSQL coverage without duplicate credit.
The ledger is 448 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded / 929 unresolved.
This increment does not claim exact NUMERIC aggregate support, arbitrary SQL
aliases in HAVING, or completion of the remaining aggregate domains.

The shared exact NUMERIC foundation now owns canonical base-10000 limbs,
separating numeric identity from display scale without floating-point
intermediates. Parsing, formatting, comparison, canonical hashing, addition,
subtraction, multiplication, rounding and truncation share bounded work,
allocation admission and cancellation. Precision/scale coercion rounds before
checking overflow and supports negative scales and scales exceeding precision.
Exact int2/int4/int8 casts accept asymmetric signed minima and round ties away
from zero; special-value cast errors retain PostgreSQL's SQLSTATE contract.

A reproducible disposable PostgreSQL 18 oracle checks 312 cases, including
values beyond binary64 precision, radix input, scale retention, non-finite
values, coercion carry overflow and integer boundaries. Six additional live
boundary summaries check the full unconstrained digit/scale domain without
checking huge rendered strings into the fixture. Seven native tests include
exhaustive allocation failures, cancellation at every observed checkpoint,
sticky admission failures and clean retries. The focused SQL test gate imports
the same kernel through the local/control source catalogs. The complete kernel
test source also compile-checks for wasm32-wasi; this is not runtime evidence
for that target. Capacity/work arithmetic uses widened integers before bounds
checks so admission cannot overflow on 32-bit hosts.

The debug-build multiplication microbenchmark allocates one output buffer;
64/256/1024 decimal-digit inputs consume 289/4225/66049 work units respectively.
The observed 1024-digit run took approximately 0.53 ms locally, excluding input
parsing. This is not an end-to-end SQL benchmark; dense multiplication remains
quadratic and explicitly work-bounded.

This is a shared-kernel foundation, not activation of the NUMERIC SQL type.
Division/remainder, exact literal binding, generated public type identity,
typed-row/index encoding, wire/spill support and aggregate integration remain
unfinished. No original parity cases are credited for kernel-only evidence:
the ledger remains 448 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded /
929 unresolved.

The next exact NUMERIC increment adds PostgreSQL-compatible division, truncated
integer division and remainder to the shared kernel. A normalized base-10000
long-division loop corrects quotient estimates with bounded reusable scratch;
an exact guard group supplies decimal rounding. Remainder is computed directly,
so a representable result is not rejected because an intermediate quotient
would overflow the stored NUMERIC domain. General remainders retain the
divisor-sized buffer rather than the larger dividend scratch allocation.

One-limb division keeps terminating exponent zeroes implicit; one-limb
remainder reduces virtual zeroes using modular exponentiation. Full-range
1e131071 / 1 and 1e131071 % 7 pass with a 64-unit work budget and a one-limb
allocation limit. The large-exponent remainder modulo 12345 matches PostgreSQL
and retains only two limbs rather than the 32769-limb dividend workspace.

The independent PostgreSQL oracle now reproduces 799 complete result/error
contracts plus ten full-domain summaries and two quotient-overflow checks.
Eleven native tests additionally cover all 9999 one-limb divisors against u128,
quotient-estimate correction/addback, every observed cancellation checkpoint
and exhaustive allocation failures across general, short and remainder paths.
For a 2048-digit numerator and 1024-digit divisor, debug microbenchmarks use
three allocations for integer quotient and two for remainder, independent of
quotient length; observed times are approximately 0.8 ms locally. General
dense division remains quadratic and explicitly work-bounded. Native tests
also compile-check for wasm32-wasi without claiming execution on that target.

Public NUMERIC activation still requires exact literal binding and generated
type identity, typed storage/index/wire/spill contracts and aggregate
integration. The parity ledger is unchanged; kernel-only tests are not credits
for original SQL cases.

The exact NUMERIC binary boundary now validates and streams PostgreSQL's
base-10000 wire representation without decimal formatting or binary64
conversion. A shared indexed-group constructor validates every input group,
including discarded fractional groups, before allocating only the significant
canonical limbs. Decoding applies PostgreSQL's declared-scale truncation before
precision/scale coercion. Short framing reports 08P01; invalid framing, signs,
scales and groups report 22P03. Logical non-finite values remain canonical while
the encoder preserves PostgreSQL's ignored infinity scale-field convention.

A disposable PostgreSQL 18 oracle reproduces 65 sender cases and 47 receiver
cases through actual binary NUMERIC parameters, not a local round-trip model.
Large outputs are checked with length and SHA-256 as well as canonical binary
bytes. Native tests cover exhaustive allocation failures, cancellation at every
observed checkpoint, sticky admission, writer errors and validation before
output. Streaming encode allocates nothing. A 65,535-group receiver retains
one significant limb in one allocation; an all-zero payload allocates nothing.
All sixteen kernel/codec tests pass and compile-check for wasm32-wasi.

This codec is shared integration infrastructure, not a claim that public
NUMERIC parameters, results or columns are activated. Exact literal binding,
generated type identity, typed storage/index/spill, scalar and aggregate
execution, and public transport dispatch still require integration. No parity
ledger credit is taken for kernel/codec-only evidence.

Exact NUMERIC identity keys now encode PostgreSQL total order directly in
lexicographic byte order. Separate ranks cover negative infinity, negative
finite values, zero, positive finite values, positive infinity and NaN. Biased
base-10000 weights and terminated group words order finite values without
decimal expansion; complemented negative payloads reverse magnitude order.
Canonical keys omit display scale, so equivalent values share one unique-key
identity. Components are self-delimiting and prefix-free, allowing multi-column
keys without a length prefix that would change numeric ordering. SQL NULL and
the owning index's type/format identity remain responsibilities of its layout.

Decode rejects noncanonical groups, invalid ranks, missing terminators, domain
overflow and extra bytes before allocating. The shared logical validator is
also used by the PostgreSQL binary encoder. Prefix decode consumes exactly one
component, retains no input ownership and recovers the smallest exact scale;
keys are not a replacement for row values that preserve display metadata.

A fresh PostgreSQL 18 dense-rank oracle supplies 235 independently ordered
values. Native tests check all 55,225 pairs, equivalent scale spellings,
composite-key prefix freedom, byte mutations, every observed cancellation
checkpoint, sticky quotas and exhaustive allocation failures. Streaming encode
allocates nothing; allocated encode and decode each use one buffer. A dense
2,048-digit value uses 1,029 key bytes; full-range powers such as 1e131071 and
1e-16383 retain seven-byte keys and pass within a 64-unit work budget. The debug
2,048-digit encode/decode microbenchmark took approximately 0.09 ms locally,
excluding parsing; this is not an end-to-end index performance measurement.

These keys are shared integration infrastructure, not activation of NUMERIC
indexes or public SQL. Generated type identity, exact literal/scalar binding,
typed row/transport integration and aggregate execution remain unfinished.
The parity ledger is unchanged.

### Exact NUMERIC typed execution and transport integration (2026-10-08)

The shared builtin/array identity now includes NUMERIC with PostgreSQL scalar
OID 1700 and array OID 1231. OpenAPI and generated Go/Python/TypeScript/Zig
contracts carry that identity. Public number columns marked `element_type:
numeric` return decimal strings, preserving precision and display scale; SQL
NULL remains JSON null, and special values use their PostgreSQL text tokens.
This does not activate NUMERIC in native relational schema/index descriptors.

Scalar and array frames, retained typed columns, portable spill blocks,
mapped batches, aggregate extrema partials and result pages retain canonical limbs
rather than interpreting their JSON-null placeholders. Physical array/spill
decoders strictly verify canonical binary representations without re-encoding
into a second buffer; admission errors are not reported as corruption. Exact
scalar casts and arithmetic use the shared kernel. Constant numeric casts are
prepared once and can evaluate without scratch allocations. Small sort keys
encode without allocating; wide values retain the exact comparison fallback.
Primitive vector kernels explicitly fall back to typed scalar execution.

Float-to-NUMERIC conversion uses PostgreSQL's six/fifteen significant decimal
digits and ties-to-even rounding, distinct from NUMERIC's ties-away integer
casts. The bounded IEEE coefficient is expanded exactly before rounding.
Text/binary streaming output avoids per-cell staging buffers. Mixed
NUMERIC/real operator and membership coercions use double precision, while
CASE/COALESCE common domains retain real, matching a fresh PostgreSQL 18 oracle.
The binder records these conversions explicitly rather than guessing from a
JSON payload during comparison.

The 38 focused NUMERIC tests cover exact scalar query results and metadata, array
storage/wire/frame round trips, binary pgwire, JSON/text conversion, immutable
retention, spill ownership, grouped extrema, UNION ALL, bounded output and
exhaustive allocation failures. MIN/MAX preserve complete input type identity.
Python SQL tests pass 25 cases; TypeScript SQL/expression tests pass 52 cases and
SDK typechecking passes; the full TypeScript SDK has 424 passing tests and one
skip. All Go SDK packages pass, including a public exact-decimal transport test.
The SDK expression validator now admits server-defined
CASE, casts, modulo and membership with matching structural arity and numeric
identity checks, rather than rejecting valid generated contracts.

Activation is still incomplete: default decimal/scientific and oversized
integer literals, SQL typmod grammar, exact SUM/AVG accumulators and dedicated
grouped NUMERIC lanes,
mixed-domain join-key normalization, native row/index/catalog integration,
broader numeric functions and native vector lanes need follow-through. No
original inventory case is credited by these infrastructure tests alone.
The ledger remains 448 implemented / 136 rejected / 73 superseded / 929
unresolved, with all 1,586 original source cases intact.

### 2026-10-08: exact NUMERIC SUM/AVG and shared partial reduction

SUM and AVG now use dedicated flat grouped lanes backed by signed i128
base-10000 buckets. Updates defer carries until finalization and allocate only
when their exponent span grows. The bucket bound is 9999 times the non-special
row count; it fits i128 for every legal i64 count. Display scale and NaN and
signed-infinity counts remain separate from finite coefficients. AVG divides
the widened sum before enforcing the public result range, so a partial sum
that would overflow as a final SUM can still cancel or produce a valid AVG.
Final results have an owned stable header and are invalidated after mutation.

The shared aggregate checkpoint is version 2 and binds the exact input element
identity as well as aggregate kind, coarse type and DISTINCT mode. NUMERIC
checkpoints retain bounded signed buckets rather than prematurely finalizing a
decimal sum. Decode validates the entire canonical record before allocating
buckets; decoded state and DISTINCT members never borrow transport bytes.
Spill and worker merges share this codec. Final spilled DISTINCT reducers send
decoded members through the external deduplicator rather than adding a partial
total or retaining a second unbounded membership table.

Exact NUMERIC SUM/AVG states are eligible for pinned scan workers and hash-spill
partition reducers; compensated floating reductions retain their ordered path.
Admission accounts for the complete replacement bucket allocation and the gap
between existing and incoming exponents, including row, worker and checkpoint
handoffs. NUMERIC batch admission currently uses ordered per-row updates to
prove each successive span change before mutation; dedicated flat storage and
allocation-free fixed-span updates remain active. A future vector admission
pass must model combined per-group spans, not merely add input limb sizes.

A live PostgreSQL 18 oracle confirms grouped sums 2996.20/2998.20 and averages
1498.1000000000000000/1499.1000000000000000 for the 2,000-row spill fixture.
Serial and spilled outputs agree, including DISTINCT and exact display scale.
Checkpoint tests cover incomplete records, signature mismatches, decoded
ownership, cached-result invalidation and exhaustive allocation failures.
Kernel tests cover cancellation/quota state preservation, special values and
overflowing sums with representable averages.

The local Debug microbenchmark reduces 10,000 copies of 1.2300 in about
0.6 ms with zero hot allocations and 176 bytes of bucket capacity; repeated
immutable kernel addition takes about 499 ms and 10,000 allocations with the
testing allocator. This measures accumulator allocation/carry overhead, not a
production query speedup or a controlled release benchmark.

Validation: `zig build sql-test pgwire-test check-openapi lake-integration-test`
passes with 567 local SQL tests (three skips), 226 server SQL tests and 161 lake
integration tests, with no failures or leaks. The pgwire/OpenAPI gates and
format/whitespace checks pass. The 46 focused NUMERIC tests pass separately.

Native scalar NUMERIC row/index/catalog descriptors, default decimal literals,
typmod grammar, broader numeric functions, mixed-domain join normalization and
native numeric vector kernels remain incomplete. Unsupported native scalar
NUMERIC descriptors fail closed instead of being stored as floating point.
This infrastructure work does not by itself credit any original inventory case;
the original ledger counts and provenance remain unchanged.

### Exact default literals and PostgreSQL rounding domains

Decimal/scientific literals and integer literals outside signed i64 now retain
their exact source spelling in the owned AST, rather than crossing f64 during
parsing. Binding prepares immutable NUMERIC constants once, preserving display
scale, large integers and public result identity through scalar and set paths.
Small integral literals retain their integer domain. Proven floating-domain
literal coercions, including explicit real/double casts, are resolved once at
bind time so primitive vector kernels do not repeatedly parse decimal text.
This does not convert expressions that belong in the NUMERIC domain: an integer
plus a decimal literal retains exact NUMERIC scalar execution.

NUMERIC abs, ceil, floor, sign, mod, round and trunc use exact typed values.
Two-argument round/trunc resolve the PostgreSQL (numeric, integer) overload,
including negative scales, strict SQL NULLs and unknown string literals; real,
double and explicit bigint scale overloads are rejected. One-argument rounding,
ceiling/floor and sign select double precision for integer/real inputs, as
PostgreSQL does. NUMERIC rounding is half-away-from-zero; double rounding is
ties-to-even. Nested scale evaluation and NUMERIC ANY/ALL share the evaluator's
work budget, including conversion work, instead of borrowing overlapping quotas.
Exact integer array probes use five stack base-10000 groups and allocate no
decimal coefficient. Numeric float parameters use the existing PostgreSQL
significant-digit conversion rather than shortest-string conversion.

Continuous percentile inputs are explicitly converted to double precision;
discrete percentiles/mode keep their source domain and cannot share a narrowed
sort stream with exact integers. Aggregate expression identity now includes
the builtin cast identity, preventing NUMERIC/double reducers from aliasing.

PostgreSQL 18 oracle checks cover rounding ties, negative scales, display scale,
NULLs, special NUMERIC values, double overload identity and SQLSTATE 42883 for
missing overloads. The latest focused gates pass 52 NUMERIC tests and the
ordered-set server regression. Function coercions distinguish unknown strings
from typed text, arrays and dates; explicit user-cast failures keep their own
SQLSTATE. Cast rewrites copy all metadata, including coercion origin. Identical
owned decimal spellings share expression work without merging different scales.
Prepared literal, rounding and exact integer-array tests destroy the parsed AST
and execute 1,000 probes per shape with a zero-capacity allocator. This verifies
ownership and zero hot allocations, not a production latency speedup.

The original inventory remains unchanged: 448 implemented, 136 rejected,
73 superseded and 929 unresolved. Remaining decimal work includes native scalar
catalog/row/index/expression-VM activation, typmods, exact sqrt/power and other numeric
functions, complete assignment/coercion coverage, mixed-domain join keys and
native NUMERIC vector kernels. These tests do not certify those unfinished
boundaries or award new inventory credits.

Native real/double literal defaults parse directly at their declared width and
retain a durable assignment cast; real literals do not round through f64 first.
Native expression lowering explicitly refuses NUMERIC instructions until that
VM has an exact decimal value domain, instead of publishing a lossy program.

Final validation: `zig build sql-test pgwire-test check-openapi lake-integration-test`
passes on the final source, with 573 local SQL tests (three existing skips),
226 server SQL tests and 161 lake integration tests, without failures or leaks.
The 84-test pgwire gate requires permission to bind disposable loopback listeners;
the restricted sandbox otherwise produces EPERM failures in three listener tests.
OpenAPI, formatting, whitespace and original-inventory integrity checks pass.

### Exact square roots and shared scalar cancellation

NUMERIC sqrt now uses an exact integer Newton kernel, not double precision.
The selected PostgreSQL display scale is clamped to 0..1000 with at least
sixteen significant digits and no less than the input scale before clamping.
An extra computed decimal digit proves final half-away rounding. Integer/real
inputs still select the double-precision overload; unknown strings use that
preferred overload, while typed text, boolean and arrays report 42883.
Negative inputs report 2201F, including negative infinity. NUMERIC NaN,
positive infinity, SQL NULL and display scales retain PostgreSQL semantics.

Exponent zeroes remain virtual. Iterations alternate two root buffers and
reset a reusable scratch arena; no per-iteration scratch survives the call.
Compact exact squares retain one coefficient group even near the maximum
exponent. Valid constant roots are statement-owned and need no per-row
allocation. Domain failures are not eagerly adopted into that cache: lazy
CASE/COALESCE branches remain lazy, as verified with PostgreSQL.

The scalar evaluator now shares the backend request cancellation/deadline
callback with ordinary expression execution and all exact numeric contexts,
not just regex operations. Work and output bounds remain independent, and
kernel cancellation preserves its sticky failure and clean retry contract.

The independent PostgreSQL oracle now contains 893 contracts, adding 94
square-root cases without replacing the original 799. Tests cover rounding
boundaries, exponent extremes, randomized 200-digit inputs, allocation-fault
unwinding, every observed cancellation checkpoint, output/work rejection,
clean retry and exact integer bracketing independent of the root algorithm.
Local Debug measurements cover both all-nines and irregular inputs at 64,
256 and 1024 decimal digits. The irregular 1024-digit fixture used roughly
149,000 work units; it is not claimed to fit the default 65,536-step scalar
budget. These microbenchmarks are not production latency comparisons.
The focused ReleaseFast run passes both root tests. Its single-shot 1024-digit
irregular sample took about 274 microseconds with six backing allocations;
the all-nines sample took about 71 microseconds with four. Allocation counts
can vary with arena growth and allocator layout. Neither sample establishes
an end-to-end query speedup or a stable latency bound.

Native scalar catalog/row/index/expression-VM activation, typmods, exact power,
broader numeric functions, assignment/coercion coverage and mixed-domain join
keys remain unfinished. No original inventory disposition is changed here.

Final-source validation passes `zig build sql-test pgwire-test check-openapi
lake-integration-test`: 575 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server
SQL tests and 161 lake integration tests, with no failures or leaks. The
pgwire and OpenAPI gates pass as well. The independent PostgreSQL generator
verifies all 893 oracle contracts; formatting, whitespace and original-case
integrity checks pass. The inventory remains 448 implemented, 136 rejected,
73 superseded and 929 unresolved; the family audit identifies DDL (340 open
contracts) as the largest remaining original-case family.

### Exact NUMERIC native array admission and logical hashing

The common NUMERIC layout boundary now validates borrowed canonical PostgreSQL
binary payloads without allocating coefficients or depending on SQL execution.
It rejects malformed groups, padding, negative zero, hidden fractional digits
and ignored/noncanonical special-value metadata. PostgreSQL parameter input
continues through its deliberately permissive receiver-normalization boundary;
restoration never repairs imported bytes into another physical representation.

Native SQL-array publication/restore validates every NUMERIC payload through
this boundary. Logical array hashes use canonical coefficient identity rather
than the scale-bearing wire header, so equal values such as 1.2 and 1.20 hash
equally while retaining distinct physical bytes and display scales. Shape,
lower bounds, SQL NULL placement and unequal values retain distinct identities.
Owned canonical decoding copies significant coefficients directly rather than
normalizing receiver input and then verifying the normalized result.

Evidence covers all 65 independent PostgreSQL sender fixtures, hash equivalence
with the logical kernel, single-bit mutation agreement with receiver/re-encoding
canonicalization, zero-allocation borrowed checks, allocation faults, sticky
work/cancellation failures, checksum-valid malformed AROW rejection and native
prepared/read/restore hash and byte round trips. A 4,096-element fixture compares
borrowed validation with full owned decoding; these local microbenchmarks are
not end-to-end workload latency measurements.

The native schema identity fixture also explicitly proves scalar NUMERIC cannot
be mislabeled as an f64 column. Native scalar catalog/row/index/expression-VM
activation, typmods, broader functions and mixed-domain join normalization remain
unfinished. Original inventory dispositions are unchanged by this prerequisite.

Validation passes `zig build sql-test pgwire-test check-openapi`: 579 local SQL
tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, and the pgwire/OpenAPI gates.
The focused native gate passes 12 array/schema/projection contracts. PostgreSQL
18 independently re-verifies all 65 binary senders and 47 receivers. Formatting,
whitespace and original inventory integrity checks pass; dispositions remain
448 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 929 unresolved.

Two single-shot ReleaseFast samples of the 98,836-byte, 4,096-element fixture
measured borrowed validation at 24–34 microseconds with zero allocations and
owned decoding at 194–208 microseconds with four backing allocations. These
measure different tasks, not competing complete query plans. The first compile
reported a 3.44 GB peak against a 3.22 GB declared RSS claim; a cached rerun and
both runtime samples pass, but this does not prove cold compilation fits that
resource claim. The final Debug fixture also passes validation and owned decode.

### Cold lake search: restart composition and warm startup admission

The persistent-cache recovery, phase diagnostics, bounded range concurrency,
packed text reads and sidecar hydration implemented earlier are now covered by
a composed ranked-search/highlighting restart regression. It starts with an
empty cache, ranks a top hit, projects display/body fields from the immutable
text sidecar and runs the production highlighter. Shutdown drains accepted
writes. A fresh cache and index writer rebuild decoded navigation from disk
with all provider read methods disabled. Scores and highlights remain valid,
with zero provider requests/bytes and nonzero disk hits. No Parquet reader is
available to mask a source-hydration fallback. This exercises immutable query
payload reuse, not offline publication discovery or a complete HTTP request.

Warm cache preparation now checks the acquire-published owner before path
allocation or startup locking. Failed initialization still takes the bounded
retry path. The server executor/restart test also verifies warm preparation
returns while the startup mutex is held; recovery tests verify the readiness
transition only follows successful initialization.

For deployment verification, keep the same node-local directory across a
graceful restart and compare `antfly_lake_cache_provider_reads_total`,
`antfly_lake_cache_provider_bytes_total`, disk hits and per-phase query timings
for the same highlighted request. Check disk-ready, initialization failure
reasons, completed/queued/dropped writes and last write error before restart.
Counters restart with the process; compare per-run deltas rather than absolute
values. An abrupt crash can lose pending cache writes without losing source
data. Cache eviction, changed object versions or credentials can legitimately
require new provider reads. These local fixtures do not establish the cause of
the observed deployment's missing cache files or quantify live GCS latency.

### Shared exact NUMERIC ordered-key boundary

The ordered-key writer and prefix parser now live in a runtime-independent
common layout. Logical SQL coefficients and canonical stored row bytes use the
same ordering implementation. A borrowed stored-value adapter validates input
before output, then streams directly from big-endian coefficients without a
limb copy or intermediate key allocation. Existing ascending bytes are
unchanged. Descending encoding complements the complete self-delimiting
component, including special ranks and terminators. Prefix admission never
interprets the following tuple component and stops at the coefficient budget.

Review also found canonical logical admission did not independently enforce
the request's coefficient cap. An old key quota assertion reused an already
failed context and therefore could not establish that invariant. Canonical
admission now checks the cap before traversal; fresh-context key/binary tests
prove rejection before writer output, with sticky failure and no allocation.

Evidence includes all 65 independent PostgreSQL sender payloads, both ordering
directions, composite suffixes, all 235 independent dense ranks and their
55,225 pairwise comparisons in each direction, malformed payloads, allocation
faults and every observed borrowed cancellation checkpoint. PostgreSQL 18
independently re-verifies all 235 ranks. Inventory dispositions are unchanged.

`zig build sql-numeric-test -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` runs 34 standalone arithmetic,
binary and key contracts without importing the server/runtime graph. Its test
compilation used 526 MB in the local run. For 256 canonical-row-to-key conversions
at 64/256/2,048 decimal digits, borrowed encoding used zero allocations versus
256 coefficient allocations for owned decoding followed by encoding. Local
optimized samples were about 1.3–1.8 times faster for the borrowed codec. These
are codec microbenchmarks, not native-index or complete-query latency claims.
The earlier broad optimized SQL compilation still reported the pre-existing
3.44 GB peak against its 3.22 GB claim; the isolated target does not fix that.

Native scalar NUMERIC schema/catalog capability activation, row-cell identity,
mutation/default/generated/check handling, ordered tuple integration and public
schema/API generation remain unfinished. Unannotated native numeric fields
retain their existing f64 meaning; this shared boundary does not activate or
credit an unsupported exact-NUMERIC schema shape.

Final validation passes `zig build sql-test pgwire-test check-openapi`: 583 local
SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests and the wire/OpenAPI
gates. The focused native schema/array/restore gate passes 12 contracts. Live
PostgreSQL 18 also re-verifies 893 arithmetic contracts, 65 binary senders and
47 receivers. Formatting, whitespace and original inventory integrity checks
pass; dispositions remain 448 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and
929 unresolved.

### Native exact NUMERIC scalar storage and ordered tuples

Native relational rows now have a distinct `numeric` physical column type bound
to the immutable SQL NUMERIC descriptor. Canonical PostgreSQL binary payloads
remain variable-width ordinal cells, not f64 or per-cell JSON. Schema/catalog
capability 20 gates both scalar NUMERIC and NUMERIC array descriptors; older
capabilities cannot silently adopt them. Unannotated native/document `number`
fields retain their established floating-point semantics.

Prepared rows consume original JSON number lexemes or explicit decimal strings
without an intermediate f64. Canonical row encoding retains display scale and
special values, while semantic hashes use typed logical identity independently
of scale. Trusted projections borrow canonical binary; strict restore validates
all coefficients even when outer AROW framing/checksums are valid. Explicit
SQL NULL and absent cells retain their existing distinct presence metadata.

Composite native index keys use the shared borrowed NUMERIC ordered-key boundary
for row cells and typed bounds. They preserve ASC/DESC and default NULL placement,
delimit document suffixes, and roll back partial tuple output on invalid input.
The native tuple fixture compares all pairs of 235 PostgreSQL dense ranks in
both directions and checks row-built keys against typed bounds. Reserved output
capacity permits tuple construction without allocating coefficient buffers.
The borrowed comparison kernel is also checked against those independent ranks.
Datetime tuple-prefix parsing now consumes its complete 128-bit physical field.

Native preparation matches all 65 PostgreSQL sender payloads byte for byte and
round-trips through logical JSON and restore. Allocation-fault tests cover wide
decimals, specials, NULL and absent values. A cold LSM column projection fixture
retains exact precision, scale and logical hashes across maintenance/reopen with
zero primary-row reads. PostgreSQL 18 independently re-verifies 893 arithmetic
contracts, 65 senders/47 receivers and 235 ordering ranks.

This does not yet activate public native SQL NUMERIC columns. Remaining work
includes generated public schema/API types and normalization, exact typed SQL
read/mutation binding, precision/scale declarations, schema-expression arithmetic
and casts under a shared request work budget, and exact native predicate kernels.
Generic document predicates reject NUMERIC cells rather than comparing binary
as text or rounding through f64. Inventory dispositions are unchanged: the new
physical boundary alone is not evidence that those public SQL cases are complete.

Public NUMERIC arrays now use the canonical generated SQLArrayElementType in
their schema annotation, rather than the narrower scalar SQLBuiltinType enum.
The definition lives in the schema specification and metadata aliases it, keeping
the generated Zig dependency direction acyclic. Python, TypeScript and Go SDK
contracts retain the NUMERIC identity. Native public schema publication, cold
LSM reopen and portable restore retain exact coefficients, scale, dimensions,
NaN and SQL NULL for those arrays.

Validation passes the full SQL, pgwire, OpenAPI and native relational-index gates:
583 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 171 native local
contracts and one server contract. The additional public NUMERIC-array
reopen/restore contract passes separately. The lake integration gate passes
79 local and 85 server contracts, including datetime tuple-prefix delimiting.
SDK SQL gates pass 34 Python and 35 TypeScript tests; TypeScript typechecking
and all Go SDK package tests also pass. The pinned package-manager test launcher
remained live without starting Vitest; the same pinned Node runtime ran the
installed Vitest entrypoint directly. No parity dispositions changed.

### Exact NUMERIC SQL page projection and mutation images

SQL projection now selects the typed-cell boundary for scalar NUMERIC as well
as arrays. Previously a scalar-only NUMERIC selection could bypass adaptation
or enter generic JSON-number coercion. The native schema-cache mapping retains
the physical NUMERIC column's exact SQL identity. Borrowed native pages share
one page-owned name directory; source lexemes parse directly to owned decimal
coefficients, and an already-rounded f64 is rejected instead of silently accepted.
Unselected ordinary scalar projections retain their existing cheap path.

The owned document decoder also builds typed rows for these selections. It
preserves precision, display scale, missing-versus-present NULL metadata, mixed
JSONB nulls and array bounds; all coefficients and borrowed primitive-array
payloads survive release of the input JSON and source page. Mutation RETURNING
images use that same typed boundary even without an array column present.

Evidence compares all 65 independent PostgreSQL binary sender payloads after
SQL projection, verifies shared page layout, rejects rounded backend cells and
required NULLs, and injects every allocation failure through mixed typed-row
ownership and mutation images. The fault harness disables address-dependent
arena remaps so failure indexes cover deterministic fallback allocations.
This is not public native NUMERIC schema/default/generated/check activation:
those boundaries and a shared schema-expression execution budget remain
unfinished. Original inventory dispositions are unchanged.

Session overlays preserve NUMERIC input before generic number coercion, not
only at the final projection boundary. Exact filter operands bind once per
cursor; their immutable coefficients and every staged-row comparison share
one bounded work context. Probes compare typed logical values, never a NUMERIC
datum's JSON-null placeholder. A scalar-only staged-row regression checks exact
equality across different display scales and retained values after cursor close.
A second fixture probes prepared bounds 1,000 times with no allocation available,
then verifies work exhaustion and rejects a pre-rounded f64 input.
The existing native API owner runs schema-cache and session-overlay contracts;
they are intentionally not pulled into the storage-independent SQL test root.

Validation passes 586 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL
tests, pgwire/OpenAPI gates, and all 12 focused native API schema-cache and
session-overlay contracts, with no failures or leaks. Formatting, whitespace,
generated control-catalog consistency and original inventory integrity checks
pass. The inventory remains 448 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and
929 unresolved; these internal boundaries do not independently credit public
NUMERIC schema/DDL cases.

### Exact NUMERIC schema execution and reader capability

The immutable schema VM now retains canonical NUMERIC bytes through literals,
column reads, arithmetic, comparisons, membership, lazy conditionals, casts and
generated/default bindings. Exact operations use the existing coefficient
kernel, not f64 or JSON-number conversion. Comparisons borrow binary limbs;
identity casts borrow their input, and negation copies only the canonical
binary payload while retaining display scale. Generated-value restore checks
compare logical NUMERIC values without filling missing outputs or repairing
forged values.

An execution context carries sticky work/cancellation admission across plans.
Numeric temporary arenas are capacity-bounded and charged monotonically along
with retained outputs, including when the caller itself uses an arena. CHECK
expression sets share this context rather than resetting numeric work at each
constraint. Deterministic kernel failures map to the established durable
validation errors, preserving activation diagnostics and transport SQLSTATEs;
cancellation and allocator failures remain distinguishable. PostgreSQL's
nonfinite-to-integer rejection retains SQLSTATE 0A000 through append-only
runtime/storage ABI identities, definite replicated-apply outcomes, C API
unsupported status and remote SQL mutation diagnostics.

Schema format/capability 21 records exact-NUMERIC expression requirements even
when all stored columns and expression outputs are integral or boolean. Public
raw generated/default declarations derive this requirement recursively; the
transactional catalog rejects an older reader capability. Strict framing
validates the added flag and truncated/corrupted records.

The native oracle gate covers 537 PostgreSQL cases: 430 arithmetic/remainder,
72 checked integer casts and 35 ordering cases (also run without an available
allocator). Allocation-fault fixtures cover preparation, scratch ownership,
default/generated dependency ordering, explicit NULL, logically equivalent
display scales and forged/missing restore values. A schema-validator generated
column fixture verifies exact rounding above 2^53 and durable capability
publication.

Public scalar NUMERIC schema annotations and generated expression enums, SQL
lowering/DDL activation, typmods and complete nonfinite native float casts
remain unfinished. The new schema
context does not yet unify defaults, generated expressions and every CHECK
form under one complete request-level quota. No original inventory case is
credited solely for this native execution infrastructure.

Validation: the combined SQL/schema-expression/archive-ABI gate exits zero,
with 586 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 24
schema-expression tests and seven archive-boundary tests, without failures or
leaks. The native relational gate passes 174 local and one server-owner test;
the focused C API status regression passes. PostgreSQL independently rechecks
all 893 kernel reference contracts. Inventory integrity, formatting,
whitespace and dependency-catalog consistency pass, with 929 cases unresolved.

The broad durable-runtime target also exposes a 14.46 GB compiler peak against
its 13.96 GB reservation and duplicate ownership of a guarded graph replay
raft-batch test. Its compile-time-filtered replicated-apply regression passes
with the new semantic error included in the expected-failure roundtrip audit;
this does not establish that the broad runtime target is green.

### Exact NUMERIC SQL schema-expression lowering

SQL schema expressions now lower exact NUMERIC literals, arithmetic, remainder,
negation, comparisons, CASE, COALESCE, membership and numeric assignment casts
into the bounded native VM. Durable column nodes explicitly record conversions
when scalar binding changes their inferred domain; an integer column is never
merely relabeled as NUMERIC. Unknown numeric input preserves PostgreSQL input
SQLSTATEs before schema validation. Typed NULLs do not choose a floating domain
for a decimal comparison or membership list.

Mixed operator comparisons use float8 when required, including precision-sensitive
integer/real and NUMERIC/real cases; CASE/COALESCE retain their separate real
common-type rules. Same-domain comparisons avoid unnecessary casts. Simple
partial-index column/literal predicates survive lowering, including checked
casts of integer/float literals. Exact NUMERIC index predicate activation remains
guarded rather than converting decimal input through binary float.

Decimal defaults retain their exact source plus their declared assignment cast.
Wide integral rounding and narrowing overflow therefore happen during mutations,
not by prematurely rounding a default through f64. Generated/default programs
using this domain require the previously introduced reader capability 21.
Native publication, omitted-value application and strict verification cover a
wide half-integer default and generated bigint, a real default, and deferred
smallint overflow.

The existing 537 PostgreSQL arithmetic/cast/order contracts now run through both
raw native programs and SQL parsing/binding/lowering. A separate independently
reproducible PostgreSQL 18 fixture covers 62 mixed-row, NULL, special-value,
conditional, membership, cast and input-error contracts. Exhaustive allocation
faults cover SQL preparation, independently owned plan literals, scratch,
successful output and failing execution. A 10,000-row exact comparison sample
requires zero scratch allocations; its Debug local sample is about 3 ms, not a
claim about deployed query latency.

This connects exact NUMERIC SQL expressions to native schema execution; it does
not complete public scalar NUMERIC activation. Public schema/generated expression
enums, typmods, exact schema constraints/index activation, dynamic text casts,
non-finite floating domains and complete shared statement/schema work accounting
remain unfinished. No original
parity case is credited solely for these infrastructure tests; 929 remain
unresolved pending source-owned execution/storage evidence.

Validation passes: 587 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL
tests and 27 schema-expression tests, with no failures or leaks. The independent
62-case PostgreSQL oracle, inventory integrity, Zig formatting, whitespace and
control-catalog consistency checks pass. These gates do not supersede the broad
durable-runtime compiler/ownership failure documented above.

### Immutable exact NUMERIC constraint compilation

The next public-NUMERIC prerequisite is an immutable constraint plan, rather
than converting minimum/maximum/exclusive bounds and multipleOf through f64.
The new internal component owns exact literals in a stable-address, 4 MiB
schema arena. Const and enum compare logical numeric values; enum candidates
are compiled into collision-checked hash buckets, deduplicating equivalent
scales without reparsing JSON during row checks. Finite JSON strings remain
strings, not numeric enum members. PostgreSQL's NUMERIC ordering governs
special values.

A request-owned execution arena reuses bounded scratch across rows, while
preserving sticky work, cancellation and quota failures. Exact remainder checks
use the same numeric kernel. Immutable borrowed bounds/enum comparisons need
no allocations. Repeated tiny-decimal remainder checks retain constant scratch
capacity, and a 10,000-probe comparison regression uses an allocator that rejects
all allocations. Exhaustive allocation failures cover plan compilation, source
JSON destruction, row parsing, and exact remainder evaluation.

The independent disposable PostgreSQL 18 oracle verifies 70 constraint
predicates, including precision above 2^53, bounds outside binary-float range,
scale-equivalent values, special values, and nonnumeric const/enum members.
This component is deliberately not advertised as public NUMERIC activation:
wiring it into schema epochs, composition/type validation, a durable reader
capability, generated public contracts, and end-to-end storage/restore tests
remains required. Existing document/physical-float constraints are unchanged.
No original parity cases are reclassified for this prerequisite.

Validation passes: 587 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL
tests, and 30 schema-expression tests, without failures or leaks. The 70-case
PostgreSQL fixture, inventory integrity, Zig formatting, whitespace, and
control-catalog consistency checks pass. The broad durable-runtime limitation
documented above is not superseded by these focused gates.

### Exact NUMERIC schema validation and durable publication barrier

The immutable constraint plans now belong to parsed schema properties and are
released with their schema epoch, including failed compilation. Recursive row
validation uses one bounded exact execution owner, parses each NUMERIC cell once
across compositions, and restores the active value scope between properties.
Bounds, const, enum and multipleOf run against the typed logical value rather
than f64 or reparsed JSON. Composition type checks distinguish integral NUMERIC
from fractional/special NUMERIC, and never reinterpret a special numeric as a
string. anyOf/oneOf/not/conditional probes preserve allocation, work and
cancellation failures instead of treating them as a nonmatching branch.

The 70 PostgreSQL constraint contracts now exercise the actual field validator
as well as the immutable component. Independent source destruction, exhaustive
allocation failures, exact tiny-decimal composition, sticky cancellation, and a
parse-once work-accounting regression cover the validator boundary. Exact
definition positivity also validates unused definitions without allowing f64
underflow to reject a positive multipleOf or conceal a negative one.

Runtime schema format 22 records a separate exact-NUMERIC-validation capability.
Physical NUMERIC codecs (20) and schema VM programs (21) do not imply support
for public scalar constraint semantics. Full and reduced runtime layouts derive
the new capability from scalar NUMERIC columns. Serialization rejects downgrade
to 21, strict decoding checks the new boolean and tail framing, and transactional
catalog binding rejects a reader/catalog that lacks this capability. The flag
requires a relational public schema with a scalar NUMERIC column; internal
NUMERIC layouts without public validation retain their older semantics.

Public scalar and expression enums remain guarded. Generated contracts,
ingress lexeme preservation, complete indexing admission, and end-to-end SQL
mutation/reopen/backup-restore validation still need activation work before
public NUMERIC can be declared complete. Existing document and physical-float
rules remain unchanged, and no original parity dispositions are reclassified.

Validation passes: 587 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL
tests, 35 schema-expression tests and 177 native relational-owner tests,
without failures or leaks. The 70-case PostgreSQL oracle, inventory integrity,
Zig formatting, whitespace and control-catalog consistency checks pass. The
previously documented broad durable-runtime compiler/ownership limitation
remains separate and is not claimed fixed by these gates.

### Public exact NUMERIC contracts and durable index activation

Public scalar SQL builtin identities and relational expression types now expose
NUMERIC in the source OpenAPI contract and regenerated Zig, Go, Python and
TypeScript clients. Relational root number properties accept the numeric SQL
annotation without changing document or unannotated floating-point semantics.
Finite input retains its exact JSON lexeme or decimal string; NaN and infinities
use strings. Const/enum finite numeric members must remain JSON numbers, not
numeric-looking strings. Typed mutation ingress has an owned-row regression for
precision above 2^53, retained scale, extreme small exponents and special values.

CHECK, expression-index and unique-expression declarations now derive the exact
schema-VM capability independently of their output type. A public integer-only
table with a NUMERIC CHECK still fences pre-capability-21 readers, while scalar
NUMERIC validation independently requires capability 22. Cold-row CHECK
evaluation borrows canonical NUMERIC coefficients. SQL expression-index DDL
retains the exact key domain instead of mislabeling it as binary float. Partial
index literal identity casts retain their exact lexemes; other literal casts
remain guarded pending bounded, PostgreSQL-compatible constant folding.

End-to-end LSM tests publish actual public schemas and SQL-generated defaults,
generated columns, CHECKs and partial covering expression indexes. Mixed invalid
batches publish neither earlier valid rows nor invalid rows. Reopen and portable
restore preserve both capability barriers, exact scale and constraints. Covered
NUMERIC reads explicitly supply the partial-index proof and require zero primary
lookups; the proof guard is not bypassed for the test.

The relational public-API test owner now imports fixtures unconditionally rather
than from a named smoke test excluded by its own compiler filters. This restores
the three FK publication/initial-create tests required by that target's ownership
audit; no filters or audits were removed.

This activates public scalar storage and schema-expression boundaries, not all
remaining SQL NUMERIC work. Public column typmods, non-finite floating-domain
casts, dynamic text casts, broader partial-index constant folding and shared
statement/reducer/schema work admission remain unfinished. Parse-once evidence
applies within validation/composition, not the complete write pipeline. Original
inventory dispositions remain unchanged; infrastructure tests do not establish
the mounted behavior of an unadjudicated source case.

Validation: 587 local SQL tests (three skips), 226 server SQL tests, 37 schema
expression tests, the full public relational-row API owner, and native NUMERIC
storage/index/reopen/restore regressions pass without failures or leaks. The
70-case disposable PostgreSQL constraint oracle, Python SQL tests (35),
TypeScript SQL tests (36), focused Go SDK tests, generated contracts, inventory
integrity, formatting, whitespace and control-catalog consistency are checked.
The broad durable-runtime compiler/ownership limitation remains separate.

### Bounded exact constant bounds for partial relational indexes

Partial-index DDL now evaluates row-independent bounds through the same native
schema-expression compiler and evaluator used by CHECK/default/generated
programs. The previous cast-only literal interpreter is removed. Admitted
constants include exact NUMERIC arithmetic, nested casts, conditional/coalesce
expressions, and the VM's scalar text/boolean vocabulary. Explicit typed NULL
casts retain their target domain instead of inheriting the unknown input type.

One folding scope spans all bounds of a predicate. It limits actual temporary
arena capacity, charges compilation and evaluation work, owns returned scalar
bytes, and preserves sticky quota/cancellation failure. Temporary compiled
plans never escape; only folded values enter the published predicate. This is
DDL preparation, not another per-row or per-query interpretation step. It is
not yet general shared admission for every SQL reducer and schema operation.
The native folding owner supports an injected cancellation checkpoint; the DDL
entry point currently supplies work/byte admission but does not yet forward a
request-wide checkpoint. That transport remains part of the shared-admission
work rather than being claimed complete by the component cancellation test.

The empty compilation environment rejects column references even in lazy arms.
Comparison promotions on the indexed column are not erased to manufacture a
sargable predicate. OR/row-dependent/unsupported-expression cases retain their
guards; broader implication and functional-index matching remain separate work.
No storage-format change or weakening of the partial-index proof is required.

A disposable PostgreSQL 18 oracle verifies 44 bounds across exact NUMERIC,
integer widths, real/double, text, boolean, NULL, special values and SQLSTATEs.
The schema VM has allocation-fault, owned-output, cumulative work, byte-admission
and cancellation regressions. The LSM covering-index/reopen/portable-restore
regression now builds its partial bound from nested numeric/integer casts and
arithmetic, still requiring zero primary lookups and an explicit query proof.
Original parity dispositions are unchanged; these infrastructure contracts do
not reclassify original cases without mounted source-owned execution evidence.

Validation: 589 local SQL tests (three skips), 226 server SQL tests and the full
schema-expression owner (38 local and five server tests), and 179 native
relational-owner tests pass without failures or leaks. The independent 44-case
PostgreSQL oracle, inventory integrity,
formatting, whitespace and control-catalog consistency checks pass.

### NUMERIC precision/scale execution boundary

An immutable dependency-neutral modifier now carries precision and signed scale
through parsed scalar/array casts and bound instructions. The existing exact
kernel performs half-away rounding followed by precision overflow checking;
negative scales and scales greater than precision follow PostgreSQL. Array
coercion preserves bounds, dimensions and NULL elements without mutating inputs.
Valid literal results remain cached. Speculative constant preparation defers
modifier overflow in unreachable CASE branches without swallowing invalid input
syntax or unrelated failures. Aggregate expression identity includes modifiers.

One evaluator budget covers array traversal, exact coercion and output ownership;
even large all-NULL arrays poll cancellation. Dynamic array execution is covered
by exhaustive allocation failures and work/byte limit regressions. A disposable
PostgreSQL 18 oracle independently records 46 values, errors, type OIDs and wire
modifiers. The execution regression compares values, SQLSTATEs, builtin identity
and direct-cast modifier encoding; it does not yet assert public/pgwire metadata.
The shared lexer also accepts strictly separated decimal digits in integer,
fractional and exponent parts, preserving source spelling and malformed-token
rejection. NUMERIC type modifier range failures have SQLSTATE 22023, not XX000.

This is an execution prerequisite, not complete modifier activation. Generated
public descriptors, pgwire result descriptors, durable column enforcement and
schema-expression reader capability fencing remain unfinished. DDL and durable
expression publication explicitly reject modifiers until those contracts can
preserve and enforce them; parsing never silently publishes an unconstrained
column or drops quantization from a durable program. Original inventory
dispositions remain unchanged at 929 unresolved cases.

Validation: `zig build sql-test antfly-schema-expression-test lib-sql-parser-test`
passes 593 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests and all
43 schema-expression tests. A final six-test focused rerun covers the subsequent
zero-allocation constant reuse and aggregate modifier-identity regressions. Both
scalar and array constants are evaluated 10,000 times with a zero-capacity row
allocator and reuse the same owned result; this is an allocation/work contract,
not an end-to-end latency benchmark. The independent 46-case PostgreSQL oracle,
inventory integrity, control-catalog consistency, formatting and whitespace
checks pass without changing original case dispositions.

### NUMERIC result identity across SQL, public clients and pgwire

Result descriptors now carry an optional immutable precision/signed-scale pair
for scalar NUMERIC and NUMERIC array elements. Catalog, scalar, aggregate,
window, derived-table, CTE, VALUES, set, mutation and RETURNING bindings preserve
that identity. PostgreSQL common-type rules retain a modifier only when every
contributing expression has the same modifier; unknown NULL arms, arithmetic,
unconstrained casts and ordinary numeric function outputs remove it. NULLIF
preserves its first operand's modifier only when comparison coercion has not
changed the result to a floating-point domain.

The public OpenAPI contract owns SQLNumericModifier, with generated Go, Python,
TypeScript and Zig descriptors. Pgwire emits PostgreSQL's modifier encoding for
scalar and array RowDescription fields and fences prepared/cursor result identity
when precision, scale or modifier presence changes. No per-row schema lookup or
heap owner is added: the descriptor contains two bounded integer values.

The independent disposable PostgreSQL 18 oracle now verifies 56 scalar cases
and 12 query descriptors, including prepared versus optimized result metadata,
negative scales, mixed NULL arms, derived scopes and mixed floating-point NULLIF.
Public client round trips and simple/extended wire-frame tests cover the new
contract. This completes result metadata, not durable modifier activation:
DDL columns and schema-expression publication remain guarded until assignment,
storage/restore validation and reader-capability fencing can enforce modifiers.
The original parity dispositions remain unchanged at 929 unresolved cases.

TypeScript's structural expression validator also admits the already activated
exact NUMERIC literal/cast/arithmetic contract, retains incompatible-domain
rejection, and charges decimal-string bytes against the shared literal budget.
The SDK typecheck and 61 SQL/expression tests pass; Python's 36 SQL tests, Go's
focused SQL transport/descriptor tests and generated-client consistency pass.

Final validation: `zig build sql-test pgwire-test check-openapi` passes 595 local
SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests and the wire/OpenAPI gates.
The focused API owner executes the generated NUMERIC descriptor regression.
The full TypeScript SDK suite passes 433 tests with one skip. Inventory integrity,
control-catalog consistency, Rust-spec synchronization, formatting and whitespace
checks pass. No original unsupported cases were reclassified by these checks.

### Strict NUMERIC modifier storage boundary

The shared exact-row boundary now separates caller-budgeted write coercion from
strict stored-byte verification. Writes parse, round and precision-check through
one execution budget before canonical encoding. Verification borrows canonical
limbs and checks precision, declared display scale and negative-scale divisibility
without allocating, formatting or rounding. A valid unconstrained encoding is
not automatically a valid constrained stored value; restore cannot silently
repair a value that violates its immutable column layout. NaN follows PostgreSQL,
while constrained infinities are rejected. Sticky cancellation/quota failures
remain authoritative even when a later call supplies an invalid modifier.

All 20 modifier cases in the independently reverified 893-case PostgreSQL exact
NUMERIC oracle exercise this boundary. Tests also cover canonical-but-unconstrained
payload rejection, every write/owned-output allocation failure and zero-capacity
verification. All 74 NUMERIC owner tests pass without failures or leaks. A Debug
probe verifies 10,000 rows with zero allocations in approximately 1.3 ms; this is
a component work/allocation measurement, not an end-to-end benchmark.

Durable activation remains incomplete: schema-owned modifier descriptors, public
schema annotation and DDL publication, assignment/default/generated enforcement,
schema-VM modifier instructions, restore integration and capability fencing must
all use this boundary before the publication guards can be removed. The original
parity dispositions remain unchanged.

### Immutable NUMERIC modifier layouts and strict native row admission

Durable schema format 23 retains precision and signed scale for scalar and array
NUMERIC columns, with a separate capability flag covering future modifier-bearing
expression programs even when their output columns are not NUMERIC. Older readers
are fenced; truncated, invalid or unfenced layouts are rejected before allocation.
Ordinary schema updates and historical row projections cannot reinterpret a column
under a different modifier. Cover fingerprints include modifier identity without
changing logical NUMERIC equality keys or prohibiting cross-modifier foreign keys.

Native row admission checks constrained scalar values and every non-NULL array
element. Untrusted array offsets are validated before element access; authenticated
projections retain their bounded shape-only path. Scalar write encoding and semantic
hashing apply the same assignment coercion. Full-text projection witnesses exclude
SQL-only reader capability flags, preserving their independent physical identity.

Validation passes 184 native relational-index tests, one server integration test,
598 local SQL tests (three existing skips), and 226 server SQL tests without failures
or leaks. Inventory integrity remains 929 unresolved. Public modifier activation
is still guarded: normalized postimages, defaults/generated evaluation order,
array assignment, public annotation, and schema-VM casts remain to be completed.

### NUMERIC array assignment before canonical row encoding and hashing

Array preparation now shares parsing and modifier coercion under one work budget
and a bounded unpublished owner. It does not alter the caller's envelope on success
or failure. Dimensions, signed lower bounds and SQL NULL flags remain authoritative;
each non-NULL value is rounded and precision-checked before canonical row encoding.
Logical JSON hashing uses the same constrained array boundary as prepared row hashes.
No physical binary is interpreted as JSON or silently repaired during strict restore.

All 20 PostgreSQL modifier expectations also run through multidimensional arrays
with NULL elements and signed bounds. Tests cover exact work exhaustion, memory
admission, every allocation failure, overflow after rounding, strict native row
validation and canonical reconstruction/re-encoding. The independent PostgreSQL 18
oracle reverified all 893 exact NUMERIC contracts. These component tests are not
end-to-end performance measurements or public durable modifier activation.

The remaining activation work is unchanged apart from array assignment: normalized
postimages, target-domain coercion before dependent defaults/generated expressions,
public schema/DDL annotation, modifier-bearing schema-VM instructions, and integrated
restore/reopen publication coverage must land before removing publication guards.
No original parity case dispositions were changed.

Final validation passes 600 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL
tests, 185 native relational-index tests and their server integration owner without
failures or leaks. The focused native array regression and six API schema-cache tests
also pass. Inventory integrity, control-catalog consistency, formatting and whitespace
checks remain green.

### NUMERIC assignment domains before defaults and generated dependencies

The native expression set now coerces constrained base inputs before dependent
expressions run, and constrains each default/generated result before it becomes
another expression's input. One caller-owned execution carries sticky work,
cancellation and retained/scratch-byte admission across every conversion. An
immutable list of constrained dependency ordinals avoids introducing a schema-width
scan on unconstrained expression evaluation. Already constrained canonical values
are reused without coefficient or output allocation.

Logical restore accepts equivalent display scales but rejects values that would
change under assignment. It never repairs the stored input. Physical restore keeps
the stricter canonical scale/precision boundary. Cold generated verification fences
modifier identity before reading a mismatched historical cell. Generated-plan
fingerprints bind target and referenced-column modifiers, while unrelated column
changes and old unconstrained programs retain their existing identities.

The new independent PostgreSQL 18 oracle verifies 11 real-table assignments,
including omitted defaults, explicit NULL, positive/negative rounding, base and
generated-target overflow, NaN and constrained infinities. PostgreSQL forbids
generated-on-generated declarations; its observer uses equivalent explicit nested
casts to check the native dependency topology, not to credit additional SQL syntax.
Native tests also cover logical-restore forgery, every allocation failure, source
identity fences, sticky cancellation/quota and 10,000 zero-allocation canonical
binding reuses (approximately 1.4 ms in Debug, not an end-to-end latency benchmark).

Public modifier activation remains guarded. The remaining prerequisites are
normalized postimages across all mapped fields, generated public schema/DDL
annotations, modifier-bearing schema-VM casts and integrated reopen/restore
publication coverage. Original parity dispositions remain unchanged.

Final-source validation passes all 46 schema-expression tests, 600 local SQL tests
(three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 185 native relational-index tests and
their server integration owner without failures or leaks. All four PostgreSQL value,
modifier, descriptor and assignment observers reverify successfully. Inventory
integrity remains 929 unresolved; control-catalog, formatting and whitespace checks
pass without changing original case classifications.

### Cold lake reads: compatibility-grouped coalescing

The requested persistent-cache diagnostics/recovery, server-owned write worker,
shutdown draining, bounded concurrent prefetch, phase timings and sidecar-based
highlight hydration are already implemented on this branch. The restart
regressions cover immutable payload reuse with the provider disabled, not
offline publication discovery or live GCS latency. Deployment verification still
requires the same node-local cache directory and per-run provider request/byte
deltas; local tests cannot explain the previously observed missing cache files.

Physical range planning now groups the complete coalescing compatibility class
before sorting offsets. Previously, interleaved object versions, codecs or
decoded-column identities could separate otherwise mergeable ranges. The new
regression reduces eight such reads to four within the configured gap policy,
verifies each original has exactly one compatible covering range, and verifies
zero-gap policy keeps all eight exact reads without padding. This is a request
count fixture, not a measured production latency improvement. Existing response
size limits and interpretation/version boundaries remain enforced.

The allocation-fault sweep also covers final output ownership: scratch sorting
storage is now freed exactly once if conversion to an owned result fails.
Unrelated in-progress SQL modifier and HTTP discovery edits are preserved.

Validation passes the 35 focused cache/reader tests, 164 lake integration tests
and all 503 lake-native tests without failures or leaks. The composed restart
test preserves ranking/highlights with zero provider requests and bytes.
Formatting and whitespace checks pass. No live GCS latency claim is made.

### Public typed array declarations and SQL DDL binding

Array expression literals now use the generated public `sql_array` enum and
require their exact builtin element identity, including typed NULLs. OpenAPI,
Go, Python, Rust, TypeScript and Zig contracts are synchronized. Public server
prechecks share the typed VM's field and arity grammar, admitting CASE and IN
without relaxing typed compilation. TypeScript bounds ordinal envelopes and
counts wire bytes without allocating a serialized copy; generated SDK round-trip
tests preserve exact integer strings, lower bounds and SQL NULL flags.

Direct CHECKs resolve columns against the pinned physical layout rather than
constructing ordered index keys. This admits logical array comparisons while
keeping array-valued ordered keys guarded. SQL CREATE/ALTER column declarations,
typed NULL defaults, same-identity array column comparisons, CASE, COALESCE and
IN lower through the existing query binder into the durable VM. Unknown NULLs
acquire their element identity from the consumer, not from their value. Generated
NUMERIC arrays retain per-element precision/signed-scale assignment coercion.

Independent PostgreSQL verification covers 36 ordering fixtures across all ten
element domains. Public defaults and direct CHECKs exercise those fixtures on
JSON and cold ordinal rows; SQL DDL tests compile generated NUMERIC arrays into
the public schema validator. Array constructors, element-changing durable casts,
non-NULL SQL array defaults and array-valued ordered keys remain unfinished and
explicitly guarded. Original inventory dispositions are unchanged; this is not
a claim of complete array or SQL parity.

Validation passes 74 local and six server schema-expression tests, 621 local
SQL tests (three existing skips) and 226 server SQL tests, without failures or
leaks. SDK checks pass: Go packages, 291 Python tests, 16 Rust unit tests plus
two integration tests, TypeScript typechecking and 478 tests (one existing skip).
The PostgreSQL ordering oracle and generated OpenAPI/Python checks pass.
Inventory integrity, control-catalog, formatting and whitespace checks pass;
all 929 unresolved original cases retain their dispositions.

### Durable NUMERIC modifier expressions and generated wire contracts

Durable scalar casts now carry validated NUMERIC precision/signed-scale
modifiers in the immutable VM node and semantic fingerprint. Assignment uses
the existing shared execution budget and canonical constrained-byte fast path;
rounding allocates bounded unpublished scratch only when needed. Overflow is
reported when a selected cast executes, not while compiling an unselected lazy
branch. Nested casts retain independent modifiers rather than overwriting the
inner coercion. NULL propagation is unchanged.

SQL lowering preserves the modifier on numeric, integer/float-to-numeric and
typed NULL casts. PostgreSQL-valid numeric lexemes such as `.00994` are carried
as validated exact decimal strings in the public literal contract instead of
being serialized as invalid raw JSON numbers. This does not round through f64.

Capability derivation traverses defaults, generated columns, CHECKs, index keys
and UNIQUE keys for modifier-bearing programs. Both full runtime and reduced
CHECK layouts publish capability 23 even with integer/boolean final results;
the durable schema round-trip retains the requirement. Existing catalog reader
fences continue to reject older capability versions.

The OpenAPI expression contract owns the optional modifier, and Zig, Go, Python,
TypeScript and Rust specification artifacts are regenerated. TypeScript local
admission rejects wrong targets, missing/extra fields, fractional precision or
scale, and out-of-range values before transport. SDK round-trips retain signed
scale and recursive argument ordering.

The durable VM matches all 42 currently lowerable scalar cases from the existing
56-case PostgreSQL modifier observer, including negative scale, scale greater
than precision, nested rounding, float4 conversion, errors, NULL and lazy CASE.
Arrays and broader functions still lacking durable VM support remain guarded;
their SQL-runtime coverage is not claimed as durable-expression activation.
The observer also reverified its 12 query descriptors, and the independent
893-case exact NUMERIC observer reverified successfully.

Native tests cover modifier identity, malformed contracts, every allocation
failure, sticky work/cancellation and 10,000 zero-allocation constrained cast
reuses (about 2.3 ms in Debug, not an end-to-end latency benchmark). The existing
CHECK fault sweep now disables address-dependent arena remaps so every allocation
failure index is deterministic rather than intermittently missed.

Public column-modifier activation remains guarded pending schema annotations,
normalization of all mapped postimage fields under a shared preparation budget,
and integrated reopen/restore publication coverage. Original parity inventory
dispositions remain 448 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 929
unresolved; this infrastructure change does not inflate case credit.

Final-source validation passes 50 durable-expression tests, 601 local SQL tests
(three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 185 native relational-index tests
and their server integration owner, without failures or leaks. SDK validation
passes 450 TypeScript tests (one existing skip), typecheck, 39 Python SQL tests,
focused Go SQL/relational transport tests, and all 17 Rust SDK unit/integration
tests. Rust validation also exposed and corrected a stale aggregate-recipe
default initializer so the current generated API builds. OpenAPI/Python/Rust
generation checks, control-catalog, inventory, formatting and whitespace checks
pass. The work is committed locally, not pushed.

### Shared SQL postimage preparation and reusable NUMERIC array scratch

Both ordinary and typed-row preparation now carry one expression execution
context through base SQL normalization, default/generated evaluation and derived
normalization. Array metadata admission and NUMERIC cells consume that same
sticky work budget. Expression staging vectors, owned outputs and UUID rewrites
also consume the preparation byte allowance. The post-expression pass visits
only default/generated SQL columns, avoiding a second validation of unrelated
base arrays. Submitted generated fields remain output-only and are ignored by
the pre-expression pass.

NUMERIC JSON assignment supports exact scalar and array precision/signed-scale
normalization without floating point. Array preparation reuses one bounded
scratch arena across cells and publishes replacement values only after every
cell succeeds. Dimensions, signed lower bounds and SQL NULL flags survive
unchanged. Preservation mode rejects values that assignment would change and
never rewrites the input; physical restore still has its stricter canonical-byte
codec checks. Unconstrained public arrays are validated without rewriting their
lexemes. This does not admit finite numeric-looking strings as scalar API numbers.

Tests reuse all 20 PostgreSQL modifier oracle cases for scalar and array JSON
assignment, sweep success/late-overflow allocation failures, check sticky
work/cancellation across scalar/array boundaries, and prove row admission cannot
reset its work quota per array. A Debug validation of 10,000 constrained array
cells uses 70 bytes of scratch, 550,154 work units and about 6.7 ms on this
machine. This bounds scratch by the largest cell; it is not an end-to-end query
benchmark and excludes the already-parsed request DOM. All 54 durable-expression
tests pass without failures or leaks, and the live PostgreSQL oracle revalidates
893 exact-NUMERIC contracts.

Public NUMERIC column modifiers remain guarded. Recursive scalar constraints,
generated-value restore verification and later physical encoding still have
separate contexts; joining those budgets, public column annotations/catalog/DDL
activation and integrated restore/reopen evidence remain required. Inventory
classifications are unchanged at 929 unresolved.

Final-source regression gates pass 601 local SQL tests (three existing skips),
226 server SQL tests, 185 native relational-index tests and their server
integration test, without failures or leaks. Control-catalog, inventory integrity,
formatting and whitespace checks pass. No generated public contracts changed.

### Shared recursive NUMERIC constraints and logical restore verification

Recursive scalar NUMERIC predicates now borrow the preparation context rather
than initializing another work/cancellation allowance. The stable constraint
owner retains its reusable bounded arena, charges owner/peak scratch memory to
the row byte allowance, and restores the caller's allocator and limb limits on
every exit. Composition still parses a scalar once across its predicates.
Ordinary and typed-row preparation pass the existing row context into validation;
standalone validation creates one context for SQL normalization, generated-value
verification and recursive scalar constraints.

Logical generated-value verification also accepts the caller's execution
context. Its unpublished arena is byte-bounded, restores caller allocators on
success and failure, and reconciles arena peak capacity against existing VM
allocation charges rather than counting the same retained output twice. Restore
continues to reject forged generated values and unconstrained assignments; it
does not fill defaults or repair stored values.

All 55 focused expression/constraint tests pass without failures or leaks. Tests
cover borrowed context identity, sticky work/cancellation across constraint and
scalar-normalization boundaries, restoration of allocators, tiny restore quotas,
and deterministic allocation-fault cleanup. Live PostgreSQL oracles revalidate
all 11 default/generated assignment fixtures and 70 constraint predicates. Inventory
classifications remain unchanged at 929 unresolved.

CHECK evaluation, physical encoding and field-local physical restore still need
their complete shared-context integration. Public NUMERIC column annotations,
catalog/DDL activation and integrated publication/reopen/restore evidence remain
unfinished; public column modifiers stay guarded. These remaining requirements
are not implied complete by the new preparation and logical-verification paths.

Final-source regression gates pass 601 local SQL tests (three existing skips),
226 server SQL tests, 185 native relational-index tests and their server
integration test, without failures or leaks. Control-catalog, inventory integrity,
formatting and whitespace checks pass. The changes are committed locally, not
pushed; the unrelated HTTP discovery edit is preserved.

### Shared CHECK admission for expressions and legacy comparisons

Logical row validation now carries the preparation execution context through
CHECK evaluation as well as normalization, generated verification and recursive
NUMERIC predicates. Recursive numeric scratch is released and charged before
CHECK starts, so the latter borrows only the remaining row allowance. Standalone
JSON and ordinal-row CHECK entry points retain convenience wrappers; shared
entry points let callers preserve work/cancellation identity across operations.
Both expression and legacy column CHECKs use bounded unpublished scratch.

Legacy NUMERIC operands parse under the shared exact context. Tuple encoders can
also borrow that context, charging canonical NUMERIC inspection/encoding and
non-numeric input/output scans while retaining independent per-key size limits.
Comparison scans consume the same allowance. Existing unscoped tuple callers
keep their byte representation and per-key limits; this does not change index
semantics or fingerprints. Failed shared tuple encoding restores the caller's
previous output prefix, including a quota failure after part of the tuple was
written. Work/cancellation failures remain errors during constraint activation,
not invalid-row diagnostics or fresh allowances.

All 58 focused tests pass without failures or leaks. New tests cover mixed
legacy NUMERIC/text and expression CHECKs on JSON and ordinal rows, sticky
quota/cancellation, tiny byte allowances, allocation-fault cleanup and the whole
recursive-constraint/CHECK pipeline sharing one budget. Borrowed literal text
comparisons are tested with an allocator rejecting every allocation: exactly
20 bytes of comparison allowance succeeds, 19 fails, and refilling the same
execution does not clear its failure. Activation propagates byte exhaustion
instead of persisting it as a bad-row finding; prior plans may have consumed
the shared allowance independently of the current row. PostgreSQL revalidates
all 235 NUMERIC dense-rank fixtures. Inventory classifications are unchanged at
929 unresolved.

Remaining: physical encoding/field-local restore context integration and public
NUMERIC column annotation/catalog/DDL activation. Legacy column CHECK comparison
domains also still inherit index-key size restrictions; decouple SQL scalar
comparison from persistent key encoding before claiming full PostgreSQL domain
parity. The shared admission work does not discharge that separate limitation.

Validation also passes 601 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server
SQL tests, 186 native relational-index tests and their server integration test,
without failures or leaks. The final borrowed-comparison classification fix is
covered by the 58-test focused rerun and a fresh complete SQL rerun. Inventory,
control-catalog, formatting and whitespace checks pass. Changes are committed
locally only; the unrelated HTTP discovery edit is excluded.

### Shared admission through physical restore validation

Selected-field physical restore now carries one execution identity through
ordinal generated-value verification, expression/legacy CHECKs and recursive
field constraints. Existing convenience entry points create one row allowance;
new shared entry points let the caller retain prior work and cancellation.
Generated verification bounds its vectors and unpublished results before
allocation, while continuing to read only dependency cells. Field materialization
charges selected byte payload traversal and uses bounded, per-field scratch;
the following field borrows the remaining allowance, not a fresh quota.
Standalone property validation also uses bounded scratch. Every scope restores
the caller's allocators and reconciles peak capacity with existing logical
charges, without counting the same nested allocation twice.

A real AROW regression spans exact NUMERIC generated arithmetic, a legacy
CHECK, minimum/multipleOf constraints and physical field materialization. It
measures combined work and rejects a one-unit-short allowance, preserving the
failure after counters are refilled. Tiny byte admission, sticky cancellation,
allocator restoration and all allocation failures are exercised. Physically
canonical but logically forged generated output remains rejected; restore does
not default, round or repair stored values. The existing dependency-only cold
reader regression remains in place.

Residual planning also recognizes the pinned scalar/SQL-array domain checks
already discharged by strict canonical physical validation. Unconstrained SQL
columns no longer require a second decode into JSON merely because they carry
SQL type identity. This avoids decoded-envelope amplification for wide arrays
and preserves room for actual residual predicates. A canonical non-null NUMERIC
array with a signed lower bound and SQL NULL exercises the zero-allocation
path with zero remaining allocation allowance. Separate minimum and maximum
length properties remain selected, so this does not discard residual schema
constraints. JSON/JSONB and other non-scalar domains stay conservative. Physical
validation and public-schema/layout binding remain prerequisites, not optional
consequences of this optimization.

This integrates semantic physical-restore validation, not lower-level physical
codec/hash traversal or all recursive non-NUMERIC validator work accounting.
Those paths still need shared kernel admission. Public NUMERIC column modifier
activation and decoupling legacy CHECK domains from persistent key limits also
remain unfinished. No original inventory disposition is changed.

Final-source validation passes 60 focused schema-expression tests, 601 local
SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 186 native relational
index tests and their server integration test, with no failures or leaks.
Inventory remains 448 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 929
unresolved. Control-catalog, formatting and whitespace checks pass. Changes
are committed locally only; the unrelated HTTP discovery edit is preserved.

### Public NUMERIC precision and signed-scale column activation

Relational root-column schemas now accept the shared
`x-antfly-sql-numeric-modifier` annotation for scalar NUMERIC and NUMERIC SQL
arrays. Strict parsing rejects malformed modifiers, non-NUMERIC identities and
nested SQL column declarations. The annotation flows through compiled validation,
immutable runtime layouts, SQL catalog descriptors and schema expression binding.
SQL scalar CREATE/ADD COLUMN declarations publish the same annotation instead of
silently dropping precision/scale or rejecting the supported scalar shape.

Assignment coercion uses the existing request-owned bounded NUMERIC execution
context before constraints, indexing and dependent generated expressions. Arrays
retain dimensions, signed lower bounds and SQL NULL flags. Capability version 23
is required even when no default, generated expression or index mentions the
column. Physical restore remains strict: it verifies constrained stored values,
never rounds or repairs them. Residual validation does not rematerialize domains
already discharged by the pinned physical layout.

Public OpenAPI and generated Go, Python, TypeScript and Zig contracts reuse
SQLNumericModifier. The array declaration modifier is genuinely optional: Go's
additional-properties serializer must not emit an invalid zero-valued modifier
for existing unconstrained declarations. Omission and signed-scale round-trip
regressions cover that boundary in Go, Python and TypeScript.

PostgreSQL independently verifies all 11 assignment/default/generated-value
fixtures used by the public-schema regression. The native LSM regression covers
overflow batch atomicity, populated-column reinterpretation rejection, index
lookup after reopen and portable restoration. This is public column activation,
not completion of SQL-array DDL, low-level physical codec/hash shared admission,
or legacy CHECK comparison decoupling from persistent key limits. Original
inventory classifications remain unchanged: 929 cases are still unresolved.

Final-source validation passes 62 schema-expression tests, 601 local SQL tests
(three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 187 native relational-index tests
and the server integration test, without failures or leaks. Go SQL/round-trip
tests, 42 Python SQL tests, 81 focused TypeScript tests, TypeScript type-checking
and 17 Rust SDK tests pass. Generated Python/Zig drift checks, OpenAPI checks,
control-catalog integrity, inventory integrity and formatting checks pass.
The large generated Go diff is the embedded compressed OpenAPI payload changing,
not hand-written query code. Changes are committed locally only; the unrelated
HTTP discovery edit is preserved.

### Logical CHECK execution without persistent-key amplification

Column/operator CHECK declarations and explicit immutable expressions now compile
into the same owned typed expression plans. Column binding and collation validation
remain schema-epoch operations; evaluating a CHECK no longer serializes a row cell
into an ordered index key. Persistent ordered-key size limits remain unchanged and
are still enforced by actual index encoding. CHECK logical domains instead use the
shared row execution work, cancellation and retained-byte admission contract.

The CHECK set no longer has separate comparison/expression runtime variants or
per-row key scratch. Dependency projection, JSON admission, cold ordinal admission,
deterministic activation failure handling and plan fingerprints use one path.
Equivalent named column/operator and explicit-expression declarations bind the same
typed plan fingerprint. Schema publication records the resulting CHECK coverage;
no new physical row encoding or index compatibility decoder is introduced.

Borrowed text/blob comparison retains binary chunk scans and ASCII collation while
charging actual inspected chunks against shared work and polling cancellation at
most 256 bytes apart. Repeated comparison cannot receive a fresh CPU quota. NUMERIC
continues using canonical borrowed views and its existing group admission.

AROW blob cells retain API base64 text, while typed operands and literals contain
decoded bytes. The VM now honors that boundary on JSON and cold rows rather than
comparing the two representations. Direct leaf comparisons decode bounded chunks
on the stack without allocating; complete base64 validation continues after an
early unequal byte or a SQL NULL counterpart. Nested programs and generated-value
verification use the same admitted decoder. Generated text/blob equality also
shares cancellable comparison work. Physical blob encoding is unchanged.

Column declarations construct their expression DOM directly instead of serializing
and reparsing large literals. Shared node/literal admission stops compilation as
soon as the CHECK set exceeds its limits, with initialized-plan cleanup intact.

A compact independent PostgreSQL fixture covers six assignments with 600 KiB
zero-filled bytea, text larger than 1 MiB, rejecting values and SQL NULL. Native
tests consume those cases through both CHECK declaration forms on JSON and AROW
ordinal rows. Cold checks succeed with every allocation denied, while actual key
encoding of the escaped blob still reports RelationalIndexKeyTooLarge. Separate
assertions prove cancellation during a long equal prefix, sticky work exhaustion
and preserved activation error semantics. The LSM regression covers batch
atomicity, reopen and portable restore with these wide constrained values.
Additional tests cover base64 chunk/padding boundaries, malformed suffixes hidden
behind early mismatches or NULLs, nested blob COALESCE, and rejection of forged
generated blob values on cold rows.

This removes the legacy column CHECK/key-domain coupling; it does not activate
array DDL, add a durable array expression domain, finish low-level codec/hash
shared admission, or widen native query/index predicate domains. The original
inventory remains 448 implemented, 136 rejected, 73 superseded and 929 unresolved.

Final-source validation passes 60 local and five server schema-expression tests,
601 local SQL tests (three existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, and 188 local
plus one server relational-storage tests, without failures or leaks. The six
independent PostgreSQL assignments, control-catalog compilation, inventory
integrity, Ruff, Zig formatting and whitespace checks also pass. These gates do
not establish completion of the remaining parity inventory or the separate
broad durable-runtime compiler-memory gate.

### Borrowed typed-array comparison boundary

The durable array-expression work now has a canonical borrowed comparison kernel
in `sql/array_comparison.zig`. Codec-authenticated pinned array views preserve the
precise element identity, row-major SQL NULL provenance, dimensions and lower
bounds. This boundary never infers types from JSON and does not itself establish
canonical-byte trust. Untrusted ingestion still crosses strict array validation.

Primitive values share the existing typed element comparator; NUMERIC uses its
canonical borrowed group views. Neither allocates a decoded element vector.
PostgreSQL's element-count, rank, dimension-length and lower-bound tie-breaks are
shared with materialized array comparison. JSONB parses only one element pair into
a reusable independently bounded arena. Shared JSON/array admission can now borrow
the row's work/cancellation context; local limits remain effective and exhaustion
or cancellation remains sticky across later comparisons. Binary text comparison
polls shared work in chunks of at most 256 bytes.

The independently regenerated PostgreSQL fixture contains 36 ordering cases across
all supported element identities: exact wide integers, NUMERIC scales/specials,
floating zero/NaN/infinities, NULL elements, empty arrays, rank/shape/bounds,
binary/C text, UUID and structural JSONB. Tests compare both directions and
reflexivity, cross-check the existing materialized path, deny every primitive
allocation, sweep JSONB allocation faults and verify sticky cancellation/quota
failures. The SQL owner explicitly imports this kernel so its tests are selected;
the generated control-source catalog includes the same source contract.

In a local Debug sample, 100 equal comparisons of a 10,000-element int64 array
took 178 ms without decoded allocations versus 201 ms when decoding one vector
per comparison. That conservative one-vector baseline peaked at 1,320,344 bytes;
comparison of two independently decoded inputs would require two vectors.
For 1,000 JSONB element pairs, scratch peaked at 2,012 bytes and was fully
released afterward. These are local workload samples, not production latency
guarantees or a claim that every query already uses borrowed array comparison.

Temporary JSONB trees borrow unescaped string and numeric tokens from pinned
input using the standard JSON scanner. The generic dynamic JSON parser owns
tokens even when allocation-if-needed is requested, so it cannot provide this
boundary. A 128 KiB string element now compares within 64 KiB of scratch;
tests retain strict syntax, escape and duplicate-key validation and sweep
allocation failures. Owned JSON parsing remains unchanged.

Materialized NUMERIC array validation, ordering and semantic hashing now use a
scoped exact context that charges its enclosing row/program on every work unit,
while retaining the array's local cap and inherited coefficient/input limits.
The parent owns cancellation polling and sticky failures, including exhaustion
of a child cap. A 1,000-limb regression checks all three operations for exact
single-charge accounting, mid-coefficient cancellation, sticky quota failure,
inherited coefficient admission and zero allocations. This checkpoint did not
yet wire scalar NUMERIC ingress or other codec owners; the ingress work below
connects those constructors and parsed array envelopes separately.

This is the comparison prerequisite for the durable typed-array VM, not public
array-expression activation. The VM's value domain, generated/default bindings,
array casts/operations, schema capability/public expression contract, array DDL,
and mounted PostgreSQL parity campaigns remain unfinished. Array DDL stays guarded
until those paths are connected. No original inventory disposition is changed.

Final-source validation passes 608 local and 226 server SQL tests, 60 local and
5 server schema-expression tests, and 188 local plus 1 server native relational
integrity tests: 1,088 passing tests, with three existing SQL skips and no failures
or leaks. The seven focused comparison/admission tests, independently regenerated
36-case PostgreSQL fixture, inventory integrity, generated control catalog,
formatting, Ruff and whitespace checks pass. Dispositions remain 448 implemented,
136 rejected, 73 superseded and 929 unresolved.

### Shared SQL array ingress execution

NUMERIC text and PostgreSQL binary constructors now borrow the caller's exact
execution identity while retaining local work limits and inherited input,
output and coefficient limits. Parsed array-envelope inspection and decoding
can share that identity too. Reported admission work is already charged when a
context is supplied; native row normalization no longer charges it again after
the walk. NUMERIC and other array columns therefore poll cancellation during
envelope admission, and native row preparation preserves cancellation rather
than reclassifying it as invalid user data.

Envelope shape, wire, byte and work-cap failures are sticky in the enclosing
context. Ordinary allocator failures keep their allocator error identity.
Owned NUMERIC modifier decoding remains unpublished and unwinds under allocation
faults. Direct NUMERIC JSON materialization also borrows its enclosing context
and respects inherited output limits.

Regressions cover 2,048-digit text/binary ingress, exact single-charge accounting,
mid-coefficient cancellation, sticky exhaustion and inherited input/coefficient
limits. The existing PostgreSQL array-envelope corpus now checks measured work
against the shared owner's counter. A 1,000-element float4 normalization test
checks cancellation before any rewrite; native numeric/float4 row normalization
checks preserve the original envelope and cancellation identity.

The durable VM value domain, public array-expression contract, array DDL and
mounted parity activation remain unfinished. Storage/binary-array codec owners
still need explicit shared-context integration; this is not a claim that every
array path is time-sliced or that row preparation parses each NUMERIC only once.
No original inventory disposition changes.

Final-source validation passes 610 local and 226 server SQL tests, 61 local and
5 server schema-expression tests, and 188 local plus 1 server native integrity
tests: 1,091 passing tests, three existing SQL skips, no failures or leaks.
All nine focused ingress tests, generated control catalog, inventory integrity,
formatting and whitespace checks pass. The larger typed-array VM activation is
not credited by these ingress checks.

### Logical row values separate from ordered key operands

The durable expression VM now owns a logical row-value domain independent of
the ordered-key operand type. Scalar ingress adapts explicitly; index expression
results project explicitly back into the scalar key domain. Batch key bindings
retain reusable logical input slots while persistent key encoding and its format
remain unchanged. Row rewrites use the same logical expression value type.

The row domain also represents canonical typed arrays as pinned bytes plus their
precise element identity, keeping SQL NULL as a distinct outer tag. It neither
infers types from JSON nor turns an extent check into a canonical trust proof.
Array comparisons reuse the borrowed canonical comparator. VM comparison scratch
is charged against the enclosing execution's remaining byte allowance, including
arena capacity that an outer invocation arena may retain; work and cancellation
remain shared. Primitive comparisons need no decoded vectors or heap allocation.

Public array columns/literals and array-valued generated/default bindings remain
guarded. Their compiler type propagation, JSON/cold-row adapters, public expression
contract, capability fencing and mounted PostgreSQL activation are still required.
This domain separation does not activate array indexes or change inventory credit.

Final-source validation passes 611 local and 226 server SQL tests, 62 local and
5 server schema-expression tests, and 188 local plus 1 server native integrity
tests: 1,093 passing tests, three existing SQL skips, no failures or leaks.
Focused scalar projection and bounded array-comparison tests, allocation-fault
cleanup, generated control catalog, formatting and whitespace checks pass.

### Durable array-expression reader capability

Schema format 24 fences array-dependent expression programs independently of
physical array columns. Declaration analysis detects array operands in CHECK,
index/UNIQUE expressions, defaults and generated programs, using exact column
names and both public wire and JSON expression representations. A scalar or
boolean result does not remove its array execution dependency. Unrelated array
columns and text literals do not over-fence scalar programs.

Older catalog capabilities reject this flag; decoding checks strict booleans
and every truncated frame before allocation. Format-23 flag-free schemas remain
readable, and text-projection fingerprints retain their prior representation.
This is a prerequisite, not public array-expression activation: compiler/DDL
guards remain until typed bindings, encoding and mounted execution are complete.
No original inventory disposition changes.

Final-source capability validation passes 611 local and 226 server SQL tests,
63 local and 5 server schema-expression tests, and 190 local plus 1 server native
integrity tests: 1,096 passing tests, three existing SQL skips, no failures or
leaks. Focused capability, generated control catalog and formatting checks pass.

### Canonical array preparation shares its enclosing execution

Array storage preparation and emission now optionally borrow the enclosing
request's work/cancellation identity. Prepared outputs retain their remaining
local work allowance across writes; neither a new array nor a repeated emission
can refill the parent budget. NUMERIC validation and encoding inherit the
parent's coefficient and output bounds instead of creating fresh cell budgets.
Output clearing and variable payload copies poll in at most 256-byte chunks.

Primitive preparation retains zero scratch allocations and one final output
allocation. JSONB canonical buffers retain their separate bounded scratch cohort;
quota exhaustion poisons the enclosing invocation, while ordinary allocation
failure remains OutOfMemory. No wire-format or logical-value semantics change.
The borrowed parent must outlive Prepared and every write.

Sixteen focused flat-array tests pass, including PostgreSQL binary fixture
round trips, repeated-write accounting, sticky cancellation during clearing and
payload emission, inherited NUMERIC limits, escaping-expanded JSONB scratch
quota exhaustion, and allocation-fault cleanup. Generated control catalog and
immutable inventory checks pass. This does not activate public array programs:
their bounded JSON-to-row adapters and compiler/DDL propagation remain pending.
Shared storage decoding and interruption inside canonical JSONB serialization
also remain separate work; this change does not claim complete time-slicing.

Integrated storage-source validation passes 615 local and 226 server SQL tests,
63 local and 5 server schema-expression tests, and 190 local plus 1 server native
integrity tests: 1,100 passing tests, three existing SQL skips, no failures or
leaks. The subsequent array-adapter source has its own validation below.

### Bounded typed-array JSON-to-row adaptation

The durable row VM has an explicitly typed array-envelope adapter. It decodes
the parsed envelope once, prepares canonical storage under the same shared work
and cancellation identity, and returns owned bytes with their precise element
kind. It does not stringify and reparse JSON or infer integer/NUMERIC identity.
NUMERIC modifiers apply before encoding; SQL NULL remains an outer value tag
and array-cell NULL flags and signed multidimensional bounds are preserved.

Scratch remains unpublished in a quota-bound arena. The final row buffer belongs
to the caller, and its retained-byte charge is added to actual scratch arena
capacity, not hidden behind a maximum of the two. All allocator and numeric
limits are restored on success and failure. Empty arrays can require no scratch;
nonempty arrays must account for scratch separately from retained output.

Public compilation, binding sites and DDL are not activated by this adapter.
They still require precise element-type propagation, generated public contracts,
row transforms and mounted execution evidence. No inventory cases are credited.

Final-source adapter validation passes all 65 local and 5 server schema tests,
with no failures or leaks. All 11 PostgreSQL binary element fixtures pass
canonical-byte identity, input-owner destruction and allocation-failure sweeps.
The 20 existing PostgreSQL NUMERIC modifier cases also run through this adapter,
checking rounding, overflow, SQL NULL flags and multidimensional bounds. Sticky
cancellation, byte exhaustion, allocator restoration, control catalog and
formatting checks pass. The 1,100-test integrated storage result above predates
this adapter; it is not reported as a full current-source gate.

### Shared strict array readers and owned result envelopes

Canonical array directories now expose budget-aware strict opening without a
SQL dependency. Directory/checkpoint/cell scans, text validation and embedded
NUMERIC coefficients charge and poll the caller's work/cancellation identity.
UTF-8 validation retains the standard vectorized validator in bounded chunks
split at codepoint boundaries. Header-only authenticated projection remains
O(rank), and is still not a canonical admission proof.

Storage decoding and strict JSONB verification use that same owner. NUMERIC
child contexts inherit input/coefficient limits; text copies poll at 256-byte
boundaries. Reported decode work has already been charged to the parent. Quota
failures remain sticky, while ordinary backing-allocation failure stays OOM.
Strict primitive and NUMERIC admission still allocate nothing; JSONB reuses
one bounded element region. Canonical JSONB serialization itself still needs
internal sorting/number-emission interruption; this is not claimed complete.

The row VM's canonical-array output path directly materializes the ordinal
JSON envelope instead of stringify/parse. Decode scratch and retained DOM
capacity are summed against the enclosing byte allowance. Managed arrays,
including nested JSONB arrays, are rehomed to the row owner before a temporary
budget leaves scope. This is a region-owned adapter: callers discard the row
region on failure, as with other leaky row DOM materializers.

Final focused validation passes 19 flat-array tests, including all 11 PostgreSQL
element fixtures, allocation-fault sweeps, sticky directory/text-copy
cancellation, inherited NUMERIC bounds, and all 256 byte mutations at a UTF-8
polling boundary plus a distinct UTF-8-valid embedded NUL case. Final-source
schema validation passes 67 local and 5 server tests, no failures or leaks.
Those tests verify result DOM ownership after source-byte destruction, exact
canonical round trips, nested allocator lifetimes and combined byte quotas.
The larger SQL/native integration revalidation remains separately tracked.

Public array-expression compilation, precise branch/result type propagation,
binding/assignment normalization, row rewrites, generated contracts and DDL
activation remain unfinished. No original inventory disposition changes.

### Typed array programs and streaming assignment regions

The durable expression compiler now retains precise array element identity in
literals, columns, conditional branches and plan results. Comparisons and IN
require matching operand identities; generated/default targets require the
exact result identity even for SQL NULL. JSON ingress prepares canonical owned
bytes; pinned values and cold ordinal reads borrow the authenticated row owner.
Historical source projection cannot reinterpret a different element type.

NUMERIC-array assignment checks canonical constrained coefficients without
allocating. When rounding is required, it streams one coefficient at a time
into an unpublished output buffer, preserving dimensions, lower bounds and
NULL flags without a decoded cell vector. Base assignments normalize before
generated dependencies execute. Restore verifies the declared target domain
and logical generated result without repairing stored values or forcing an
equivalent display scale.

Request-region allocation accounting now has an opt-in monotonic footprint.
Frees and shrinks cannot refund bytes that an enclosing arena may retain;
moving replacements reserve their complete allocation. Ordinary reclaiming
owners retain their existing accounting. Execution scratch and output capacity
share the same allowance, including intermediate buffers, and quota/cancellation
failures remain sticky without converting ordinary backing OOM into a quota.

Cold dictionary index batches bind array dependencies as logical row operands,
checking NULL slots before dictionary addressing. Scalar expression keys reuse
the existing ordered codec; array-valued ordered keys remain explicitly guarded.
Explicit row rewrite adapters retain canonical payloads and exact element
identity without a JSON round trip. This does not authorize ordinary restore
to rewrite historical rows.

The 10,000-cell Debug assignment fixture produces 161,270 output bytes using
five backing allocations and 505,224 total charged allocation bytes, with no
flat cell vector. Tracked allocation bytes exactly equal the invocation charge.
The observed approximately 10 ms is a local sample, not a production benchmark.
Existing PostgreSQL oracle fixtures cover 11 binary arrays across nine element
domains, with NUMERIC covered separately by 20 modifier boundary cases and
generated assignment tests. No new parity disposition is inferred from these
internal adapters. Public generated expression contracts, SQL DDL/lowering,
direct array CHECK declarations and mounted activation campaigns remain work.

Validation is recorded as separate receipts, not a green combined invocation:
SQL revalidation passes 620 local and 226 server tests with three existing skips.
Final schema validation passes 72 local and five server tests, including
generated-array assignment and both physical-domain and derivation rejection.
Native validation passes all 192 local tests and its server contract, including
the new NULL dictionary-slot and rewrite-identity regressions. These runs have
no failures or leaks. An earlier combined run failed because the fixture omitted
required catalog flags; its corrected successor also exposed that the strict
codec rejects an invalid target coefficient before a forged row can be built.
The final test asserts that rejection and separately constructs a domain-valid
wrong generated value. No production validation was relaxed to make it pass.
Formatting, whitespace and the storage control-catalog check pass. No original
inventory dispositions or public feature claims are changed by this unit.

### Bounded immutable constant preparation and PostgreSQL lazy demand

Binding now separates mandatory unknown-literal input functions from optional
constant evaluation. Invalid raw array input still fails in an unselected
branch, while errors from typed runtime conversions and NUMERIC modifiers stay
lazy. Disabling optional preparation does not disable input validation or change
which runtime branches are demanded. Genuine backing allocation failures and
internal errors are not hidden as optimization misses.

Constant arrays, exact numbers and membership indexes share bounded work and
allocation cohorts per bound program. Purity is classified in one topological
pass rather than repeatedly walking overlapping subtrees. Successful regions
are adopted without cloning; their arena owners remain heap-stable because
JSONB DOM containers retain allocator pointers. Program moves preserve those
owners, and failed publication unwinds regions and membership indexes. These
are per-program bounds, not statement-wide preparation/cancellation admission.

An independent PostgreSQL 18 oracle verifies 16 values and SQLSTATEs. Native
tests run each case with optional caches both enabled and disabled, exercise
exhaustive allocation failures, enforce preparation/output quotas, and retain
the owner-move regression. A 10,000-row Debug repeated-execution fixture uses
zero evaluation allocations and 936 bytes of constant backing storage (not
total program memory); its approximately 2.25 ms is a local sample, not a
production latency claim. The full SQL gate passes 625 local and 226 server
tests with three existing skips and no failures or leaks.

The schema-expression gate also passes 74 local and six server tests, with no
failures or leaks. Formatting, oracle script lint and the storage control-catalog
check pass. Unrelated HTTP discovery changes are preserved and not included.

Durable dynamic array constructors, element-changing durable casts, non-NULL
SQL array defaults and broader array operations remain unfinished. Original
inventory dispositions are unchanged; cache correctness is not evidence of
activating those cases.

### Durable array identity and streaming NUMERIC modifier casts

The native expression VM, SQL schema lowering and public structural precheck
now admit precisely typed array identity casts and NUMERIC-array modifier
casts. An identity cast borrows canonical pinned input. Modifier casts reuse
the streaming assignment kernel: one coefficient scratch region, preserved
dimensions/lower bounds/NULL slots, sticky shared work and allocation admission,
and no reconstructed flat cell vector or JSON round trip. Already constrained
inputs remain allocation-free. Typed NULL retains its array domain, and nested
casts retain distinct modifiers rather than overwriting an operand's cast.

CASE and COALESCE still execute only selected branches. Overflow is a runtime
error, not a schema-publication failure. Typed compilation continues to reject
element-changing casts and scalar/array reinterpretation. The generated public
specification, Go embedded specification, Python/TypeScript descriptions, Rust
bundled specification and Zig contracts document the same boundary. The large
Go diff is its compressed embedded OpenAPI payload, not a runtime refactor.

Evidence extends all 11 independent binary-array fixtures with identity casts
across pinned values, JSON input and cold ordinal rows. NUMERIC casts use the
existing 20 modifier fixtures, independently reverified within all 893 exact
PostgreSQL NUMERIC contracts. A SQL lowering regression checks query/VM byte
agreement across typed NULL, nested modifiers, unselected overflow, JSON input
and cold rows. Exhaustive allocation faults now exercise compiled cast plans
and their streaming conversion; constrained reuse is checked with a failing
allocator. This is not complete array-constructor/cast activation: dynamic
constructors, element-changing casts and non-NULL SQL array defaults remain
unfinished, and no original inventory case is reclassified by these tests.

The combined SQL/schema/OpenAPI validation passes 626 local SQL tests (three
existing skips), 226 server SQL tests, 74 local schema tests and seven public
server expression tests, without failures or leaks; all 144 build steps pass.
Python generation checks, TypeScript type-checking, Go SDK OpenAPI tests and
Rust specification synchronization also pass. Formatting, whitespace, storage
control-catalog and original inventory integrity checks pass; 929 original
cases remain unresolved.

A final cache audit additionally stops preparation after its allocation cohort
is exhausted. Retrying a smaller candidate with a sticky quota flag could hide
a later genuine backing allocation failure. The separate final-source constant
gate passes all seven tests, including the new exhaustive mixed-size candidate
fault sweep. This follow-up does not change expression demand or parity counts.
