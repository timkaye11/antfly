# CLI Packaging

Antfly has separate packages for SDKs and CLI installation:

- Python SDK: `antfly-sdk`
- TypeScript SDK: `@antfly/sdk`
- Go Antfly Lite binding: `github.com/antflydb/antfly/go/pkg/antflylite`
- Python CLI installer: `antfly-cli`
- npm CLI installer: `@antfly/cli`

The CLI packages do not build Antfly from source. They repack the native Zig
runtime archives produced by the main release workflow.

The native Zig runtime archives are also the distribution vehicle for Antfly
Lite's C ABI. Each archive contains:

```text
antfly
share/
lib/
include/antfly.h
README.md
LICENSE
```

`lib/` contains the platform-specific `libantfly` shared library. Language
bindings that embed Lite, including the Go `antflylite` binding, link against
that library and include `include/antfly.h`.

The Python, npm, and Homebrew CLI installer packages preserve the same Lite C
ABI files from the native archive. Consumers that need embedded Lite can install
one of those packages or unpack the native runtime archive, then point their
language binding at the packaged `libantfly` library. The Go `antflylite`
module carries a matching header copy for standalone builds, but the release
packages and archives also keep `include/antfly.h` available for direct C
consumers.

## Release Flow

1. Publish the normal Antfly release tag, for example `v0.2.0`.
2. The main release workflow uploads native archives under
   `https://releases.antfly.io/antfly/v0.2.0/`.
3. The release workflow downloads those archives, repacks them, and publishes
   `antfly-cli` and `@antfly/cli`.

The CLI workflow also supports manual runs with a version input and `cli/v*`
tags for republishing or recovery. Trusted publishing for the normal release
path should be configured against `.github/workflows/antfly-release.yml`.

The packaging script expects these release archives:

```text
antfly_0.2.0_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
antfly_0.2.0_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
antfly_0.2.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

Those archives must include `include/antfly.h` and the platform library
under `lib/`; `scripts/packaging/build_zig_release_archive.sh` builds the normal
runtime and then the `lite-capi` target into the same archive prefix.

For prerelease tags, npm uses the release version directly. Python wheels use
PEP 440 equivalents, for example `v0.2.0-dev10` becomes `0.2.0.dev10`.
Stable npm releases publish with the `latest` dist-tag. Prerelease npm versions
publish with the `next` dist-tag, so `npm install -g @antfly/cli` stays on the
latest stable release and `npm install -g @antfly/cli@next` can install RC/dev
builds.

It creates:

```text
dist/cli-packages/python/antfly_cli-0.2.0-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl
dist/cli-packages/python/antfly_cli-0.2.0-py3-none-manylinux_2_28_aarch64.whl
dist/cli-packages/python/antfly_cli-0.2.0-py3-none-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl
```

and populates npm platform packages:

```text
@antfly/cli-darwin-arm64
@antfly/cli-linux-arm64
@antfly/cli-linux-x64
```

The top-level `@antfly/cli` package exposes the `antfly` bin and delegates to
the right platform package at runtime.
